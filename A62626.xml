            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Shall neither trouble the <hi>Reader,</hi> nor my ſelf, with any apology for the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe <hi>Sermons.</hi> For if they be in any meaſure truly ſerviceable to the end for which they are deſign'd, to eſtabliſh men in the Principles of Religion and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to them the practice of it with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advantage, I do not ſee what Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is neceſſary, and if they be not ſo, I am ſure none can be ſufficient. However if there need any, the common heads of excuſe in theſe caſes are very well known; and I hope I have an equal right to them with other men.</p>
            <p>I ſhall chuſe rather in this <hi>Preface,</hi> to give a ſhort account of the following <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes;</hi> and as briefly as <hi>I</hi> can to vindicate a ſingle <hi>paſſage</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi> of them from the Exceptions of a <hi>Gentleman</hi> who hath been pleas'd to honour it ſo far as to write a whole Book againſt it.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of theſe <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> is four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59944:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and of <hi>ſcoffing at Religion;</hi> which I am ſorry is ſo neceſſary to be done in this Age. This I have endeavour'd in the <hi>two firſt</hi> of theſe <hi>Diſcourſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To recommend Religion to men from the great and manifold <hi>advantages</hi> which it brings both to <hi>publick Society</hi> and to <hi>particular perſons.</hi> And this is the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To repreſent the <hi>excellency,</hi> more particularly, of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> and <hi>to vindicate the practiſe of it</hi> from the ſuſpicion of thoſe <hi>grievous troubles and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties</hi> which many imagine it to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded withall. And this is the ſubject of the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>ſixth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To perſwade men to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this holy Religion, from the <hi>great obligation which the profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> lays upon men to that purpoſe; and more particularly, from the glorious rewards of another life; which is the deſign of the <hi>two laſt Diſcourſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having given this ſhort account of the following <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> I crave leave of the <hi>Reader</hi> to detain him a little longer, whilſt I vindicate a <hi>paſſage</hi> in the firſt of theſe <hi>Sermons,</hi> from the aſſaults of a whole <hi>Book</hi> purpoſely writ againſt it. The <hi>Title</hi> of the
<pb facs="tcp:59944:4"/>
               <hi>Book</hi> is <hi>Faith vindicated from the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Falſhood.</hi> The Author Mr. <hi>J. S.</hi> the famous <hi>Author of Sure footing.</hi> He hath indeed in this laſt Book of his, to my great amazement, quitted that glorious. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi> Not that I dare aſſume to my ſelf to have put him out of conceit with it, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving convinc'd him of the phantaſticalneſs of it. No, I deſpair to convince that man of any thing, who after ſo fair an admonition does ſtill perſiſt to maintain,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Letter of Thanks</hi> p. 24, &amp;c.</note> that <hi>firſt and ſelf-evident Principles</hi> not onely may, but are fit to be demonſtrated; and<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid. p. 11.</note> that thoſe ridiculous identical Propoſitions, that <hi>Faith is Faith,</hi> and a <hi>Rule is a Rule,</hi> are <hi>firſt Principle,</hi> in this Controverſie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> without which nothing <hi>can be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly concluded either about Rule or Faith.</hi> But there was another reaſon for his quitting of that <hi>Title,</hi> and a prudent one indeed: He had forſaken the defence of <hi>Sure footing,</hi> and then it became convenient to lay aſide that <hi>Title,</hi> for fear of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting people any more in mind of that Book.</p>
            <p>I expected indeed after his <hi>Letter of Thanks,</hi> in which he<note n="*" place="margin">P. 14.</note> tells us, he <hi>intended to throw aſide the rubbiſh of my</hi> Book, <hi>that in his Anſwer he might the better lay open the Fabrick of my Diſcourſe, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:59944:5"/>there to doe, but to ſpeak to ſolid Points; I</hi> ſay, after this, <hi>I</hi> expected a full Anſwer to <hi>the ſolid Points</hi> (as he is pleaſed to call them) of my Book; and that, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his excellent method of <hi>removing the rubbiſh,</hi> in order to the pulling down of a building) the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of my Book would long ſince have been demoliſh'd and laid even with the ground. But eſpecially, when in the concluſion of that moſt civil and obliging Letter, he threatn'd <hi>never to leave follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his blow, till he had either brought Dr.</hi> Still. <hi>and me to lay Principles that would bear the teſt, or it was made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all the world that we had none:</hi> I began (as I had reaſon) to be in a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fear of him, and to look upon my ſelf as a dead man. And indeed who can think himſelf ſo conſiderable as not to dread this mighty man of <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> this Prince of <hi>Controvertiſts,</hi> this great Lord and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour of <hi>Firſt Principles?</hi> But <hi>I</hi> perceive that great minds are mercifull, and do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times content themſelves to threaten when they could deſtroy.</p>
            <p>For inſtead of returning a full Anſwer to my Book, he (according to their <hi>new mode</hi> of confuting Books) manfully falls a nibbling at one ſingle <hi>paſſage</hi> in it, <hi>pag. 118.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he makes me to ſay (for <hi>I</hi> ſay no ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:59944:5"/>thing) that <hi>the Rule of Chriſtian Faith, and conſequently Faith it ſelf, is poſſible to be falſe,</hi> Nay in his <hi>Letter of Thanks,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 13.</note> he ſays <hi>it is an avow'd Poſition,</hi> in that place, <hi>that Faith is poſſible to be falſe.</hi> And to give the more countenance to this calumny, he chargeth the ſame <hi>Poſition (in equivalent terms) of the poſſible falſhood of Faith, and that as to the chiefeſt and moſt fundamental Point, the Tenet of a Deity,</hi> upon the forementioned <hi>Sermon.</hi> But becauſe he knew in his conſcience, that I had <hi>avow'd</hi> no ſuch <hi>Poſition,</hi> he durſt not cite the words either of my <hi>Book</hi> or <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> leſt the Reader ſhould have diſcover'd the notorious falſhood and groundleſneſs of this Calumny: Nay he durſt not ſo much as refer to any particular place in my Sermon, where ſuch a <hi>paſſage</hi> might be found. And yet this is the Man that has the face to charge others with falſe citations, to which charge, before I have done, I ſhall ſay ſomething, which (what effect ſoever it may have upon him) would make any other man ſufficiently aſham'd.</p>
            <p>But yet I muſt acknowledge, that in this <hi>Poſition</hi> which he faſtens upon me, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours me with excellent company, my Lord <hi>Faulkland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi> Perſons of that admirable
<pb facs="tcp:59944:6"/>ſtrength and clearneſs in their <hi>Writings,</hi> that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> when he reflects upon his own ſtyle and way of reaſoning, may bluſh to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that ever he has read them. And as to this <hi>Poſition</hi> which he charges them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, I do not know (nor have the leaſt reaſon upon Mr. <hi>S's</hi> word to believe) any ſuch thing is maintained by them.</p>
            <p>As for my ſelf, whom I am now onely concern'd to vindicate, I ſhall ſet down the <hi>two Paſſages</hi> to which I ſuppoſe he refers.</p>
            <p>In my <hi>Sermon,</hi> I endeavour (among other things) to ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> upon this account: <hi>Becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more evidence for things than they are capable of.</hi> To make this good, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thus: Ariſtotle <hi>hath long ſince ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, how unreaſonable it is to expect the ſame kind of Proof for every thing, which we have for ſome things. Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical things being of an abſtracted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are onely capable of clear Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. But Concluſions in Natural Philoſophy, are to be prov'd by a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Induction of experiments; things of a Moral nature, by Moral Arguments, and Matters of Fact by credible Teſtimony. And though none of theſe be ſtrict De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, yet have we an undoubted
<pb facs="tcp:59944:6"/>aſſurance of them, when they are prov'd by the beſt Arguments that the nature and quality of the thing will bear. None can demonſtrate to me, that there is ſuch an Iſland in</hi> America <hi>as</hi> Jamaica; <hi>yet upon the Teſtimony of credible perſons, and Authours who have written of it, I am as free from all doubt concerning it, as from doubting of the cleareſt Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Demonſtration. So that this is to be entertained as a firm Principle, by all thoſe who pretend to be certain of any thing at all, that when any thing is prov'd by as good Arguments as that thing is capable of, and we have as great aſſurance that it is, as we could poſſibly have ſuppoſing it were, we ought not in reaſon to make any doubt of the exiſtence of that thing. Now to apply this to the preſent caſe. The being of God is not Mathematically demonſtrable, nor can it be expected it ſhould; becauſe onely Mathematical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters admit of this kind of evidence. Nor can it be prov'd immediately by ſenſe, beauſe God being ſuppos'd to be a pure Spirit, cannot be the object of any corporeal ſenſe. But yet we have as great aſſurance that there is a God, as the nature of the thing to be prov'd is capable of, and as we could in reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:59944:7"/>expect to have, ſuppoſing that he were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this paſſage it muſt be (if any thing in the <hi>Sermon</hi>) that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> chargeth this <hi>Poſition (in equivalent terms) of the poſſible falſhood of Faith, and that as to the chiefeſt and moſt fundamental Point, the Tenet of a Deity.</hi> And now <hi>I</hi> appeal to the Reader's Eyes and Judgment, whether the ſum of what <hi>I</hi> have ſaid, be not this, That though the exiſtence of God be not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that ſtrict kind of Demonſtration which Mathematical matters are, yet, that we have an undoubted aſſurance of it. One would think that no man could be ſo ridiculous as from hence to infer, that <hi>I</hi> believe it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, notwithſtanding this aſſurance; that there ſhould be no God. For however in many other caſes an undoubted aſſurance that a thing is, may not exclude all ſuſpicion of a poſſibility of its being otherwiſe; yet in this <hi>Tenet of a Deity</hi> it moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does. Becauſe whoever is aſſur'd that there is a God, is aſſur'd there is a Being whoſe exiſtence is and always was neceſſary, and conſequently is aſſured that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he ſhould not be, and involves in it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. So that my Diſcourſe is ſo far from being <hi>equivalent</hi> to the <hi>Poſition</hi> he mentions, that it is a perfect contradiction to it. And he might with as much truth
<pb facs="tcp:59944:7"/>have affirm'd, that <hi>I</hi> had expreſly, and in ſo many words ſaid that there is no God.</p>
            <p>The other paſſage is in <hi>pag. 118.</hi> of my <hi>Book,</hi> concerning <hi>the Rule of Faith. I</hi> was diſcourſing that no man can <hi>ſhew by any neceſſary argument, that it is naturally impoſſible that all the Relations concerning</hi> America <hi>ſhould be falſe.</hi> But <hi>yet</hi> (ſay I) <hi>I ſuppoſe that notwithſtanding this, no man in his wits is now poſſeſt with ſo incredible a folly, as to doubt whether there be ſuch a place. The caſe is the very ſame as to the certainty of an ancient Book, and of the ſenſe of plain expreſſions: We have no demonſtration for theſe things, and we expect none; becauſe we know the things are not capable of it. We are not infallibly certain, that any Book is ſo ancient as it pretends to be; or that it was written by him whoſe Name it bears; or that this is the ſenſe of ſuch and ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in it; it is poſſible all this may be otherwiſe: But we are very well aſſur'd that it is not, nor hath any prudent man any juſt cauſe to make the leaſt doubt of it; For a bare poſſibility that a thing may be, or not be, is no juſt cauſe of doubting whether a thing be or not. It is poſſible all the people in</hi> France <hi>may dye this night, but I hope the poſſiblity of this doth not
<pb facs="tcp:59944:8"/>incline any man in the leaſt to think it will be ſo. It is poſſible that the Sun may not riſe to morrow morning; yet for all this I ſuppoſe that no man hath the leaſt doubt but that it will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To avoid the cavils of this impertinent Man, I have tranſcrib'd the whole <hi>Page</hi> to which he refers. And now where is this <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow'd Poſition of the poſſible falſhood of Faith?</hi> All that I ſay is this, That we are not <hi>infallible</hi> either in judging of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of a Book, or of the ſenſe of it; by which I mean (as any man of ſenſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity would eaſily perceive I do) that we cannot demonſtrate theſe things of, as to ſhew that the contrary neceſſarily involves a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; but yet that we may have a firm aſſurance concerning theſe matters, ſo as not to make the leaſt doubt of them.</p>
            <p>And is this <hi>to avow the poſſible falſhood of Faith?</hi> And yet this <hi>Poſition</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> charges upon theſe words; how juſtly I ſhall now examine.</p>
            <p>Either by <hi>Faith</hi> Mr. S. means the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> reveal'd by God, and then the meaning of the <hi>Poſition</hi> muſt be, <hi>that what God ſays, is poſſible to be falſe;</hi> which is ſo abſurd a <hi>Poſition</hi> as can hardly enter into any man's mind; and yet Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath the modeſty all along in his <hi>Book</hi> to inſinuate
<pb facs="tcp:59944:8"/>that in the forecited <hi>Paſſage</hi> I ſay as much as this comes to.</p>
            <p>Or elſe Mr. <hi>S.</hi> means by <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>aſſent</hi> which we give to Doctrines as reveal'd by God; and then his ſenſe of infallibility muſt be either that whoever aſſents to any thing as reveal'd by God, cannot be deceiv'd, upon ſuppoſition that it is ſo reveal'd; or elſe abſolutely, that whoever aſſents to any thing as reveal'd by God, cannot be deceiv'd. Now although I do not, in the <hi>Paſſage</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, ſpeak one ſyllable concerning Doctrines reveal'd by God, yet I affirm (and ſo will any man elſe) that an aſſent to any Doctrine as revealed by God, if it be reveal'd by him, is impoſſible to be falſe. But this is onely an infallibility <hi>upon ſuppoſition,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more than this, <hi>That if a thing be true, it is impoſſible to be falſe.</hi> And yet the principal deſign of Mr. <hi>S's Book</hi> is to prove this, which I believe no man in the world was ever ſo ſenſeleſs as to deny. But if he mean <hi>abſolutely,</hi> that whoever aſſents to any Doctrine as reveal'd by God, cannot be deceiv'd, that is, that no man can be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken about matters of Faith (as he muſt mean, if he pretend to have any adverſary, and do not fight onely with his own ſhadow,) this I confeſs is a very comfortable aſſertion, but I am much afraid it is not true.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59944:9"/>
            <p>Or elſe laſtly, By <hi>Faith</hi> he underſtands the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> of Faith. And then the plain ſtate of the controverſie between us is this, <hi>Whether it be neceſſary to a Chriſtian belief to be infallibly ſecur'd of the means whereby the Chriſtian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is convey'd to us, and of the firmneſs of the Motives upon which our belief of it is grounded.</hi> This indeed is ſomething to the purpoſe; for though in the <hi>paſſage</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-cited, I ſay not one word concerning the Motives of our Belief of the Chriſtian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, yet my diſcourſe there was intended to be apply'd to the <hi>means</hi> whereby the knowledge of this Doctrine is convey'd to us. However, I am contented to joyn iſſue with Mr. <hi>S.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both theſe Points.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That it is not neceſſary to the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Faith,</hi> that the <hi>Motives</hi> upon which any man believes the Chriſtian Doctrine ſhould be abſolutely concluſive, and impoſſible to be falſe. That it is neceſſary, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ſeveral times affirms in his <hi>Book;</hi> but how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, appears from certain and daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Very many Chriſtians (ſuch as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>as ſav'd not by the quickneſs of their underſtandings, but the ſimplicity of their belief</hi>) do believe the Chriſtian Doctrine upon incompetent grounds, and their belief is true, though the argument
<pb facs="tcp:59944:9"/>upon which they ground it be not (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ſays) <hi>abſolutely concluſive of the thing:</hi> And he that thus believes the Chriſtian Doctrine, if he adhere to it, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ſhall undoubtedly be ſav'd; and yet I hope Mr. <hi>S.</hi> will not ſay that any man ſhall be ſaved without true Faith. I might add, that in this <hi>Aſſertion</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by thoſe of his own Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For they generally grant, that</hi> General Councils, <hi>though they be infallible in their</hi> Definitions <hi>and</hi> Concluſions, <hi>yet are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo in their</hi> Arguments <hi>and reaſonings about them. And the</hi> Guide <hi>of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 35.</note> expreſly ſays, <hi>that it is not neceſſary that a Divine Faith ſhould always have an external rationally infallible ground or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thereto (whether Church Authority, or any other) on his part, that ſo believes.</hi> Here is a man of their own Church <hi>avowing</hi> this <hi>Poſition, that Faith is poſſible to be falſe.</hi> I deſire Mr. S. who is the very <hi>Rule</hi> of Controverſie, to do juſtice upon this falſe <hi>Guide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt acknowledge that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> attempts to prove this <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> and that by a very pleaſant and ſurprizing Argument, which is this. <hi>The profound Myſteries o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But be that as it will; does Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt believe that a <hi>Motive of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeeming impoſſible to be falſe,</hi> is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to convince any man, that has and uſes <hi>the light of natural Reaſon,</hi> of the truth of a thing <hi>which muſt needs ſeem to him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be true?</hi> In my opinion theſe two ſeeming impoſſibilities are ſo equally matched that it muſt needs be a drawn Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle between them. Suppoſe the thing to be believed be <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> this indeed is a very <hi>profound</hi> Myſtery, and is (to ſpeak in Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. phraſe) <hi>of its own nature ſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly impoſſible,</hi> that I know no <hi>argument</hi> in the world ſtrong enough to cope with it. And I challenge Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to inſtance in any <hi>Motive of Faith</hi> which is, both to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and our ſenſes, more plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be falſe than their Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is evidently impoſſible to be true. And if he cannot, how can he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
<pb facs="tcp:59944:10"/>expect that any man in the World ſhould believe it?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That it is not neceſſary to the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Faith,</hi> that we ſhould be infallibly ſecur'd of the means whereby the Chriſtian Doctrine is convey'd to us; particularly of the Antiquity and Authority of the Books of Scripture, and that the expreſſions in it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly bear any other ſenſe. And theſe are the very things I inſtance in, in the <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage</hi> ſo often mention'd. And to theſe Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ought to have ſpoken, if he intended to have confuted that <hi>paſſage.</hi> But he was reſolv'd not to ſpeak diſtinctly, knowing his beſt play to be in the dark, and that all his ſafety lay in the confuſion and obſcurity of his talk.</p>
            <p>Now that to have an infallible ſecurity in theſe <hi>particulars</hi> is not neceſſary to the true nature of Faith is evident upon theſe two accounts; becauſe Faith may be without this infallible ſecurity, and becauſe in the particulars mention'd it is impoſſible to be had.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe Faith may be without this infallible ſecurity. He that is ſo aſſur'd of the Antiquity and Authority of the Books of Scripture, and of the ſenſe of thoſe Texts wherein the Doctrines of Chriſtianity are plainly delivered, as to ſee no juſt cauſe to doubt thereof, may really aſſent to thoſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
<pb facs="tcp:59944:11"/>trines though he have no infallible ſecurity. And an aſſent ſo grounded I affirm to have the true nature of Faith. For what degree of <hi>aſſent,</hi> and what ſecurity of the <hi>Means,</hi> which convey to us the knowledge of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity are neceſſary to the true nature of Faith is to be eſtimated from the end of Faith, which is the ſalvation of mens ſouls. And whoever is ſo aſſur'd of the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> of Scripture, as to believe the Doctrine of it, and to live accordingly, ſhall be ſaved. And ſurely ſuch a belief as will ſave a man hath the true nature of Faith, though it be not infallible. And if God have ſufficiently provided for the ſalvation of men of all capacities, it is no ſuch reflection upon <hi>the goodneſs and wiſedom of providence,</hi> as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> imagines, that he hath not taken care that every man's Faith ſhould arrive to the degree of infallibility; nor does our bleſſed Saviour, for not having made this proviſion, deſerve <hi>to be eſteem'd by all the world not a wiſe Lawgiver, but a mere Ignoramus and Impoſtor,</hi> as<note n="*" place="margin">Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinthus Cantuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis <hi>P. 77.</hi>

            <p>Beſides, this aſſertion <hi>that infallibility is neceſſary to the true nature of that aſſent which we call Faith,</hi> is plainly falſe upon another account alſo; becauſe Faith admits of degrees. But Infallibility has none. The
<pb facs="tcp:59944:11"/>Scripture ſpeaks of a weak and a ſtrong Faith and of the increaſe of Faith; but I never heard of a weak and ſtrong Infallibility. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is the higheſt perfection of the knowing faculty, and conſequently the firmeſt degree of aſſent upon the firmeſt grounds, and which are known to be ſo. But will Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ſay, that the higheſt degree of aſſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of degrees, and is capable of increaſe? Infallibility is an abſolute impoſſibility of being deceived; now I deſire Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to ſhew me the degrees of abſolute impoſſibility; and if he could doe that, and conſequently there might be degrees of Infallibility, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> would think fit to call any degree of Infallibility a <hi>weak Faith</hi> or aſſent.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe an infallible ſecurity in the particulars mention'd is impoſſible to be had; I mean in an ordinary way, and without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle and particular revelation; becauſe the nature of the thing is incapable of it. The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſecurity we have of the antiquity of any Book is humane Teſtimony, and all humane Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony is fallible for this plain reaſon becauſe all men are fallible. And though Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in defence of his beloved Tradition is pleas'd to ſay that humane Teſtimony in ſome caſes is infallible, yet I think no man before him was ever ſo hardy as to maintain that the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb facs="tcp:59944:12"/>of fallible men is infallible. I grant it to be in many caſes certain; that is, ſuch as a conſiderate man may prudently rely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon, and hath no juſt cauſe to doubt of; and ſuch as none but an obſtinate man or a fool can deny. And that thus the learned men of his own Church deſine <hi>certainty</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> (if he would but vouchſafe to read ſuch Books) might have learnt from<note n="*" place="margin">De lo.

               <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> who ſpeaking of the firmneſs of humane Teſtimony in ſome caſes (which yet he did not believe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible) defines it thus, <hi>thoſe things are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain among men, which cannot be deny'd without obſtinacy and folly.</hi> I know Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is pleas'd to ſay, that <hi>certainty</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> are all one.

               </gap>g to Mr. <hi>Wh.</hi> true certainty may conſiſt with a poſſibility of the contrary, and conſequently Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in thinking certainty and infallibility to be all one. Nay, I do not ſind any two of them agreeing among themſelves, about the notions of infallibility and certainty. Mr. <hi>Wh.</hi> ſays, that what ſome call <hi>moral certainty,</hi> is true certainty, though it do not take away a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of the contrary. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> aſſerts the direct contrary, that Moral certainty is only probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity becauſe it does not take away the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the contrary. The <hi>Guide in Controverſies</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 135.</note> differs from them both, and makes <hi>moral, certain</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> all one. I deſire that they would agree theſe matters among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before they quarrel with us about them.</p>
            <p>In brief then, though <hi>moral certainty</hi> be ſometimes taken for a high degree of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which can onely produce a doubt full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; yet it is alſo frequently us'd for a firm and undoubted aſſent to a thing upon ſuch grounds as are fit fully to ſatisfie a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man; and in this ſenſe I have always us'd this <hi>Term.</hi> But now <hi>inſallibility</hi> is an abſolute ſecurity of the underſtanding from all poſſibility of miſtake in what it believes. And there are but two ways for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:59944:13"/>to be thus ſecur'd; either by the perfection of its own nature, or by ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural aſſiſtance. But no humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding being abſolutely ſecur'd from poſſibility of miſtake by the perfection of its own nature (which I think all mankind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Mr. <hi>S.</hi> have hitherto granted) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that no man can be infallible in any thing, but by ſupernatural aſſiſtance. Nor did ever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility upon any other account, as every one knows that hath been converſant in the Writings of their Learned men. And Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> in his<note n="*" place="margin">P. 88, 89.</note> Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> hath not the face to contend for any other infallibility but this, that <hi>the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table God can actually preſerve a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table creature from actual mutation:</hi> But I can by no means agr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e with him in what immediately follows, concerning the <hi>Omniſcience</hi> of a creature; that God, <hi>who is abſolutely omniſcient, can teach a rational Creature all truths ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or expedient to be known; ſo that though a man may have much igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet he may be in a ſort omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent within a determinate ſphere. Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient within a determinate ſphere,</hi> is an infinite within a finite ſphere; and is not that a very pretty ſort of knowing all things,
<pb facs="tcp:59944:13"/>which may conſiſt with a ignorance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things? Of all the <hi>Controvertiſts</hi> I have met with (except Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> is the happieſt at theſe ſmart and ingenious kind of reaſonings.</p>
            <p>As to the other <hi>Particular</hi> of the ſenſe of Books, it is likewiſe plainly impoſſible, that any thing ſhould be deliver'd in ſuch clear and certain words as are abſolutely incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any other ſenſe; and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, the meaning of them may be ſo plain as that any unprejudic'd and reaſonable man may certainly underſtand them. How many <hi>Definitions</hi> and <hi>Axioms,</hi> &amp;c. are there in <hi>Euclid,</hi> in the ſenſe of which men are univerſally agreed, and think themſelves undoubtedly certain of it? and yet the words in which they are expreſs'd, may poſſibly bear another ſenſe. The ſame may be ſaid concerning the Doctrines and Precepts of the H. Scriptures; and one great reaſon why men do not ſo generally agree in the ſenſe of theſe as of the other is becauſe the intereſts, and luſts, and paſſions of men are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the one than the other. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever uncertainty there may be in the ſenſe of any Texts of Scripture, Oral Tradition is ſo far from affording us any help in this caſe that it is a thouſand times more uncertain and leſs to be truſted to; eſpecially if we
<pb facs="tcp:59944:14"/>may take that to be the Traditionary ſenſe of Texts of Scripture, which we meet with in the <hi>Decretals</hi> of their <hi>Popes,</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of ſome of their <hi>Councils;</hi> than which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any thing in the whole world more abſurd and ridiculous: And whence may we expect to have the infallible Traditional ſenſe of Scripture, if not from the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives</hi> of their Church?</p>
            <p>This may abundantly ſuffice for the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that <hi>Paſſage</hi> which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> makes ſuch a rude clamor about, as if I had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in deny'd the truth and certainty of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but durſt never truſt the Reader with a view of thoſe <hi>words</hi> of mine upon which he pretended to ground this Calumny. But the world underſtands well enough, that all this was but a ſhift of Mr. <hi>S'</hi> s for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his own Party, and a pitifull Art to avoid the vindication of <hi>Sure-footing,</hi> a Task he had no mind to undertake.</p>
            <p>And yet the main deſign of this <hi>Book</hi> which he calls <hi>Faith vindicated,</hi> &amp;c. is to prove that which I do not believe any man living ever denyed, <hi>viz.</hi> That what is true is not poſſible to be falſe: Which, though it be one of the plaineſt Truths in the world, yet he proves it ſo fooliſhly, as would make any man (if it were not evident of it ſelf) to doubt of it. He proves it from

               <hi>Logick,</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> and <hi>Ethicks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I</hi> wonder he did not do it likewiſe from <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Geometry, the Principles</hi> whereof, <hi>he</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I have here <hi>(Reader)</hi> preſented thee with a Diſcourſe which (if we may believe Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) <hi>is more than Mathematically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative.</hi> A rare Sight indeed! And is not this a pleaſant Man, and of good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? I now find it true, which he<note n="*" place="margin">Letter of Thanks <hi>P. 1.</hi>
               </note> ſays elſewhere, <hi>that Principles are of an inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> genius, <hi>and ſelf-confident too, and that they love naturally to expreſs themſelves with an aſſuredneſs.</hi> But certainly the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>names</hi> of <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> were never ſo profan'd by any Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Might not any one write a Book of ſuch <hi>Jargon,</hi> and call it Demonſtration? And would it not equally ſerve to prove or confute? If he intended this <hi>ſtuff</hi> for the ſatisfaction of the People, he might as well have writ in the <hi>Coptick</hi> or <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Language: yet I cannot deny, but that it is very ſuitable to the Principles of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church;</hi> for why ſhould not their <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> as well as their <hi>Service</hi> be in an unknown Tongue? that the one may be as ſit to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their knowledge, as the other is to raiſe their devotion. But if he deſigned this for the Learned, nothing could be more
<pb facs="tcp:59944:17"/>improper; for they are far leſs apt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire <hi>non-ſenſe</hi> than the common People: And I deſire that no man (how learned ſoever he may think himſelf) would be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confident, that this is ſenſe. I do verily believe, that neither <hi>Harphius,</hi> nor <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brochius,</hi> nor the profound <hi>Mother Juliana,</hi> have any thing in their writings more ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and obſcure than this Diſcourſe of his, which he <hi>affirms to be more than Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically Demonſtrative.</hi> So that if I were worthy to adviſe Mr. <hi>S.</hi> he ſhould give over this pretence to <hi>Science;</hi> for whatever he may think, his Talent certainly does not lie that way; but he ſeems to be as well made for a <hi>Myſtical Divine,</hi> as any man I know; and methinks his <hi>Superiours</hi> ſhould be ſenſible of this, and employ him to write about the <hi>Deiform fund of the Soul,</hi> the <hi>ſuper-eſſential life,</hi> the <hi>method of ſelf-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation,</hi> and the <hi>paſſive unions of nothing with nothing:</hi> Theſe are profound <hi>Subjects,</hi> and he hath a <hi>Style</hi> peculiarly fitted for them. For even in this <hi>parcel of ſtuff</hi> which I have now cited, there are five or ſix <hi>words,</hi> ſuch as <hi>may-not-bees, potentiality, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, actuation, determinative, ſupervene</hi> and <hi>ſubſume,</hi> which if they were but well mingled and diſcreetly ordered, and brought in now and then with a <hi>that is,</hi> to explain
<pb facs="tcp:59944:17"/>one another) would half ſet up a man in that way, and enable him to write as Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal a Diſcourſe as a man would wiſh. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of this. And I have treſpaſs'd not a little upon mine own diſpoſition in ſaying thus much, though out of a juſt indignation as confident Non-ſenſe.</p>
            <p>It is time now to draw toward a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this debate. I ſhall onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leave with the <hi>Reader</hi> a few obſervations concerning this <hi>Book</hi> of Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s and his Doctrine of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the main drift of his <hi>Book</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prove that what is true is impoſſible to be falſe, he oppoſes no body that I know of in this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in aſſerting Infallibility to be neceſſary to the true nature of Faith he hath the generality of his own Church his profeſſed Adverſaries. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> never arrogated to her ſelf any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Infallibility but what ſhe pretends to be ſounded upon <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s promiſe to ſecure his Church always from Errour by a <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural aſſiſtance,</hi> which is widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. <hi>S</hi>'s rational infallibility of <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ſurely cannot be ignorant, that the <hi>Divines</hi> of their Church (till Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> and Mr. <hi>White</hi> found out this new way) did generally reſolve
<pb facs="tcp:59944:18"/>Faith into the infallible Teſtimony of the Church, and the infallibility of their Church, into our Saviour's Promiſe; and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the true Church into the <hi>Markes of the Church,</hi> or <hi>the Motives of credibility;</hi> which <hi>Motives</hi> are acknowledg'd to be only <hi>prudential,</hi> and not <hi>demonſtrative.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">I. 4. de Eccleſ.</note> 
               <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Marks</hi> of the Church do not make it <hi>evidently true,</hi> which is the true Church, but onely <hi>evidently credible; and that</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is ſaid to be evidently credible which is neither ſeen in it ſelf, nor in its principles; but yet hath ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo weighty Teſtimonies, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very wiſe man hath reaſon to believe it.</hi> Becanus<note n="*" place="margin">Sum. Tom. 2. partic. de tide <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>that the Motives of credibility are onely the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a prudent, but not of an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſent,</hi> I know very well that Mr. <hi>Knott</hi> and ſome others would fain perſwade us, that an aſſent <hi>in ſome ſort</hi> infallible may be built upon <hi>prudential Motives,</hi> which is as abſurd as it's poſſible; but if it were true, yet Mr. <hi>S.</hi> would not accept of this <hi>ſort of</hi> infallibility; nothing leſs will ſerve him than <hi>demonſtrative Motives,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>abſolutely concluſive of the thing. Stapleton</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> tells us) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſays, that ſuch <hi>an infallible certitude of Means</hi> is not now neceſſary to the <hi>Paſtors</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59944:18"/>of the Church, as was neceſſary to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> who were the firſt founders of the Church. So that, according to theſe <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> there may be true Faith where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the means nor the Motives of it are ſuch as to raiſe our aſſent to the degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. And this is as much to the full as any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> (that I know of) ever ſaid. Nay, even his <hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> and Mr. <hi>Creſſy,</hi> are guilty of the ſame <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fundamental Errour,</hi> as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> calls it<note n="†" place="margin">Letter to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer, <hi>p. 5.</hi>
               </note>. For they grant leſs aſſurance than that which is infallible to be ſufficient to Chriſtian Faith, and that we are juſtly condemn'd if we refuſe to believe upon ſuch evidence as does ordinarily ſatisfie prudent men in humane affairs. And particularly, Mr. <hi>Wh.</hi> makes a queſtion whether humane nature be capable of infallibility; as I have ſhewn at large by clear and full Teſtimonies out of each of theſe <hi>Authors,</hi> in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>Sure-footing</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>c, &amp;c.</note>. Of which <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> though Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath not though fit to take the leaſt notice throughout his <hi>Book;</hi> yet I cannot but think it a reaſonable requeſt, to deſire him to vindicate the <hi>Divines</hi> of his own Church (eſpecially thoſe of his own way) from theſe things, before he charge us any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59944:19"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Mr. <hi>S.</hi> by this <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> that infallibility is neceſſary to the true nature of Faith, makes every true believer infallible in matters of Faith; which is ſuch a <hi>Paradox,</hi> as I doubt whether ever it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into any other man's mind. But if it be true, what need then of any infallibility in <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Council?</hi> And if this infallibility be grounded upon the nature of Oral Tradition, what need of ſupernatural aſſiſtance? I doubt Mr. <hi>S.</hi> would be loth to preach this Doctrine at <hi>Rome;</hi> I have often heard, that there is an old teaſty <hi>Gentleman</hi> lives there, who would take it very ill that any one beſides himſelf ſhould pretend to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That Mr. <hi>S.</hi> by <hi>his</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples does plainly exclude from ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation the generality of his own Church, that is, all that do not believe upon <hi>his</hi> Grounds. And this is the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his reaſoning in a late <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,</hi> intituled, <hi>The method to arrive at ſatisfaction in Religion:</hi> The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples whereof are theſe; That <hi>the Church is a Congregation of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;</hi> The <hi>Faithfull</hi> are thoſe <hi>who have true Faith;</hi> That, <hi>till it be known which is the true Faith, it cannot be known which is the true Church;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59944:19"/>That <hi>which is the true Faith, can onely be known by the true Rule of Faith,</hi> which is <hi>Oral Tradition;</hi> And that the infallibility of <hi>this Rule</hi> is <hi>evident to common ſenſe.</hi> And from theſe principles he concludes<note n="*" place="margin">Sec. 21.</note> that <hi>thoſe who follow not this Rule, and ſo are out of this Church, can have no true Faith;</hi> And that <hi>though many of the Points to which they aſſent are true, yet their aſſent is not Faith; for Faith (ſpeaking of Chriſtian Faith) is an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent which cannot poſſibly be falſe.</hi> So that the Foundation of this Method is the ſelf-evident infallibility of Oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which hath been ſufficiently conſider'd in the <hi>Anſwer to Sure footing,</hi> which yet remains unanſwer'd. That which I am now concern'd to take notice of, is the conſequence of this <hi>Method,</hi> which does at one blow excommunicate and un-Chriſtian the far greateſt part of his own Church. For if all who do not <hi>follow Oral Tradition</hi> as their onely Rule of Faith are out of the Church, and can have no true Faith, then all who follow the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> no Chriſtians. For nothing is plainer, than that <hi>that Council</hi> did not make Oral Tradition the ſole Rule of their Faith, nor rely upon it as ſuch; which hath been prov'd at large in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>Sure footing,</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59944:20"/>
            <p>But why is Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ſo zealous in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of infallibility? There is a plain reaſon for it. He finds that confidence, how weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever it be grounde, hath ſome effect upon the common and ignorant People; who are apt to think there is ſomething more than ordinary in a ſwaggering man, that talks of nothing but <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Demonſtration.</hi> And ſo we ſee it in ſome other Profeſſions. There are a ſort of People very well known, who find that the moſt effectual way to cheat the People is always to pretend to <hi>infallible</hi> Cures.</p>
            <p>I have now done with his Infallibility. But I muſt not forget this <hi>Letter of Thanks.</hi> I ſhall wholly paſs by the paſſion and ill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of it, which a man may plainly ſee to have proceeded from a gall'd and uneaſie mind. He would fain put on ſome pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but was not able to conceal his vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor ſhall I inſiſt upon his palpable ſhuſſling about the explication of the Terms, <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi> He was convinc'd that he had explain'd them very untowardly, and therefore would gladly come off by ſaying that he did not intend <hi>explication,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 7.</note> but onely to <hi>praedicate</hi> or <hi>affirm</hi> ſomething of them. And yet the whole deſign of the firſt page of <hi>Sure-footing</hi> is to ſhew the neceſſity of beginning with the <hi>meaning of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:59944:20"/>words which expreſs the thing under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate:</hi> And this <hi>method</hi> he tells us he will <hi>apply to his preſent purpoſe,</hi> and will <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine well</hi> what is <hi>meant</hi> by thoſe <hi>words</hi> which expreſs the thing he was to diſcuſs, namely, The R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE of FAITH. Now if to <hi>examine well what is meant by words,</hi> be not to go about to <hi>explain</hi> them, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf to be in a great errour. Of the ſame kind in his Apology for his <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> as if they were<note n="*" place="margin">P. 105.</note> 
               <hi>not intended againſt the Proteſtants;</hi> whereas his <hi>Book</hi> was writ againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and when he comes to his <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> he<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footing.</hi> P. 126.</note> declares the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of them to be, to <hi>ſecond by Authority</hi> what he had before eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Reaſon.</hi> So that if the <hi>Rational part</hi> of his <hi>Book</hi> was intended againſt the Proteſtants, and the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies</hi> were deſign'd to ſecond it, I cannot underſtand why he ſhould ſay <hi>one</hi> was leſs intended againſt them than the <hi>other.</hi> But it ſeems he is ſo conſcious of the weakneſs of thoſe Teſtimonies, that he does not think them ſit to ſatisfie any but thoſe who believe him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>As to his charge of <hi>falſe citations,</hi> it is but the common artifice of the Roman Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſts when they have nothing elſe to ſay. However that the world may ſee how little he is to be truſted, I ſhall inſtance in two or
<pb facs="tcp:59944:21"/>three about which he makes the loudeſt cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and leave it to the <hi>Reader</hi> to judge by theſe of his ſincerity in the reſt.</p>
            <p>He ſays,<note place="margin">P. 62.</note> I notoriouſly abuſe the <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Ruſhworths Dialogues</hi> in citing the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of it to ſay that <hi>ſuch certainty as makes the cauſe always to work the ſame effect though it take not away the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute poſſibility of working otherwiſe, ought abſolutely to be reckon'd in the degree of true certainty;</hi> whereas (ſays Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) he onely tells us there, <hi>p. 7. that by moral certainty [ſome underſtood] ſuch a certainty as makes the cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. To vindicate my ſelf in this, I ſhall onely ſet the <hi>Author</hi>'s words before the <hi>Reader's</hi> eyes. They are theſe. <hi>This term</hi> Moral certainty, <hi>every one explicated not like; but ſome underſtood by it ſuch a certainty as makes the cauſe always work the ſame effect, though it take not away the abſolute poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of working other ways. Others call'd that a</hi> moral certainty <hi>which proceeds from,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A third explication of this word is,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Of theſe three the firſt ought abſolutely to be reckon'd in the degree of true cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and the Authors conſider'd as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in undervaluing it.</hi> Is this onely to tell us that by moral certainty <hi>ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,</hi> &amp;c. Does not the <hi>Prefacer</hi> alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb facs="tcp:59944:21"/>affirm, that what theſe <hi>ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by moral certainty, ought abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be reckon'd in the degree of true cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty?</hi> which is the very thing I cited him for.</p>
            <p>Another heavy charge is,<note place="margin">P. 65.</note> that <hi>according to my uſual ſincerity,</hi> I quote <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s Nephew to ſay, that a few good words are to be caſt in concerning Scripture, <hi>[for the ſatisfaction of indifferent men who have been brought up in this verbal and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpect of the Scripture,] whereas</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) <hi>in the place you cite, he onely expreſſes, it would be a ſatisfaction to indifferent men to ſee the poſitions one would induce them to embrace main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by Scripture.</hi> Does he onely ſay ſo? let the Reader judge. The words in Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> are theſe: <hi>Yet this I muſt tell ye, that it were a great ſatisfaction for indifferent men, that have been brought up in this verbal and apparent reſpect of the Scripture, to ſee that the Poſitions you would induce them unto, can be and are maintain'd by Scripture, and that they are grounded therein.</hi> Certainly one would think that either this man has no eyes or no fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt out-cry of all, is,<note place="margin">p. 57, 77.</note> that I abuſe his firſt <hi>Demonſtration</hi> by vertue of a
<pb facs="tcp:59944:22"/>direct falſification both of his words and ſenſe, by cogging in the word. <hi>[all,]</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his principle run thus, that <hi>the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt hopes and fears are applied to the minds of [all] Chriſtians.</hi> This indeed I make to be his <hi>Principle</hi> grounded upon his words which I had cited a little before; and they are theſe, <hi>Firſt; That Chriſtian Doctrine was at firſt unanimouſly ſettled by the Apoſtles in the hearts of the faithfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd in great multitudes over ſeveral parts of the world.</hi> 2ly, <hi>That this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was firmly believed by [all] thoſe faithfull to be the way to Heaven, and the contradicting or deſerting of it to be the way to damnation; ſo that the greateſt hopes and fears imaginable were, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the divine Authority, ſtrongly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the minds of the firſt Believers,</hi> &amp;c. Now if theſe <hi>firſt believers,</hi> to whom he ſays, <hi>theſe hopes and fears were ſtrongly apply'd,</hi> be <hi>all thoſe faithfull</hi> he ſpoke of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which were <hi>diſpers'd over ſeveral parts of the world,</hi> (as the tenor of his words plainly ſhews) what are theſe leſs than all the Chriſtians of that Age? and he himſelf a little after tells us, there is the ſame reaſon of the following Ages. So that I made his <hi>Principle run no otherwiſe</hi> than he himſelf had laid it. And if it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb facs="tcp:59944:22"/>what he ſays elſewhere, it is no new or ſtrange thing. I wonder more at his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in charging ſuch <hi>falſifications</hi> upon me as every man's eyes will preſently confute him in. Methinks though a man had all <hi>Science,</hi> and all <hi>Principles,</hi> yet it might not be amiſs to have ſome <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only ſpeak a few words to the two <hi>ſolid Points,</hi> (as I may call them) of his <hi>Letter,</hi> and I have done.</p>
            <p>I had charg'd him that he makes Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions certainty a <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſelf-evident Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> and yet that he goes about to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it; which I ſaid was impoſſible to be done, and if it could be done was needleſs. To avoid this inconvenience which he found himſelf ſorely preſs'd with all, he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes between <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Practical</hi> ſelf-evidence, and ſays that things which are <hi>practically</hi> ſelf-evident may be demonſtrated, but thoſe that are <hi>ſpeculatively</hi> ſo, cannot. But he muſt not think to ſhelter himſelf from ſo palpable an abſurdity by this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent diſtinction. For let things be <hi>evident</hi> how they will, <hi>ſpeculatively</hi> or <hi>practically,</hi> 'tis plain that if they be Principles <hi>evident of themſelves</hi> they need nothing to evidence them; and if they be <hi>firſt</hi> Principles there can be nothing to make them more evident, becauſe there is nothing before them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
<pb facs="tcp:59944:23"/>them by. Now if Mr. <hi>S.</hi> had in truth believed that the certainty of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſelf-evident Principle,</hi> he ſhould by all means have let it alone, for it was in a very good condition to ſhift for it ſelf; but his blind way of Demonſtration is enough to caſt a miſt about the cleareſt Truth in the world. But perhaps by the <hi>ſelf-evident</hi> certainty of Tradition, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> onely means that it is evident to <hi>himſelf,</hi> for I dare ſay it is ſo to no body elſe. And if that be his meaning he did well enough to endeavour to demonſtrate it; it was no more than needed.</p>
            <p>The other Point is about his <hi>Firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> ſuch as theſe, <hi>a Rule is a Rule, Faith is Faith,</hi> &amp;c. which he ſays<note n="†" place="margin">P. 11.</note> 
               <hi>muſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all that can be ſolidly concluded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about</hi> Rule <hi>or</hi> Faith. Of theſe he hath mighty ſtore, and bleſſeth himſelf in it, as the <hi>Rich man</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> did in his full Barns, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, thou haſt</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>laid up for many years;</hi> and out of an exceſs of good nature pities my caſe, who did <hi>undertake to write a Diſcourſe about the Ground of Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 74.</note> 
               <hi>without ſo much as one Principle to bleſs my ſelf with.</hi> But the miſchief is, that after all this ſtir about them they are good for nothing, and of the very ſame ſtamp with that frivolous one
<pb facs="tcp:59944:23"/>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks of [<hi>if a thing be, it is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Analyt. Poſter.</hi> l. 1</note>] which he rejects as a vain and ridiculous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Such are Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s firſt Principles, <hi>ſurfeited of too much truth</hi> (as an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious <hi>Writer</hi> of his own Church ſays of them) and ready to burſt with ſelf-evidence, and yet by ten thouſand of them a man ſhall not be able to advance one ſtep in knowledge, becauſe they produce no concluſion but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; whereas it is of the nature of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to yeild a Concluſion different from themſelves. And to convince Mr. <hi>S.</hi> fully of the foolery of theſe Principles, I will try what can be done with them, either in a <hi>Categorical</hi> or <hi>Hypothetical</hi> Syllogiſm, e. g. <hi>A Rule is a Rule, Tradition is a Rule,</hi> Ergo <hi>Tradition is a Rule.</hi> Again, <hi>If a Rule be a Rule, then a Rule is a Rule; But a Rule is a Rule,</hi> Ergo. How is any man the wiſer for all this? But it may be Mr. <hi>S.</hi> can make better work with them, and manage them more dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly, ſo as to <hi>principle</hi> any thing that can <hi>be ſolidly concluded</hi> in any Controverſie.</p>
            <p>And now I hope at laſt to have given Mr. <hi>S.</hi> full ſatisfaction; ſince he has brought me to the very point he deſir'd, to acknowledge <hi>that I have no Principles.</hi> And indeed if there be no other to be had but ſuch as theſe, I do declare to all the world, that I neither have any <hi>Principles,</hi> nor will have any.</p>

            <p>IN this Chapter <hi>Job</hi> diſcourſeth of the ſecrets of nature, and the unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfections of the works of <hi>God.</hi> And the reſult of his diſcourſe is this. That a perfect knowledge of Nature is no where to be found but in the Author of it; no leſs wiſdom and underſtanding than that which made the world and contrived this vaſt and regular frame of Nature can throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Philoſophy of it and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſo vaſt a deſign: But yet there is a <hi>knowledge</hi> which is very proper to man and lies level to humane underſtanding; and that is the <hi>knowledge</hi> of our Creator and of the duty we owe to him; the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of pleaſing God, by doing what he commands and avoiding what he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids: This <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> may be attained by man, and is ſufficient to make him happy. <hi>And unto man he ſaid:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59944:25"/>Behold! the fear of the Lord that is Wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words conſiſt of two Propoſitions, which are not diſtinct in ſenſe, but one and the ſame thing variouſly expreſs'd; For <hi>wiſedom</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi> are <hi>ſynonymous</hi> words here; and though ſometimes they have different notions, yet in the <hi>Poetical Books of Scripture</hi> they are moſt frequently uſed as words equivalent, and do both of them indifferently ſignifie either a <hi>ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative knowledge</hi> of things, or a <hi>practical skill</hi> about them, according to the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the matter or thing ſpoken of. And ſo likewiſe <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>departure from evil,</hi> are <hi>phraſes</hi> of a very near ſenſe, and like importance; and therefore we find them ſeveral times put together in Scripture:<note place="margin">Pro. 3.7. Pr. 16.6.</note> 
               <hi>Fear the Lord,</hi> and <hi>depart from evil: By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</hi> So that they differ onely as <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> which by a <hi>Metonymie</hi> uſual in all ſorts of Authors, are frequently put one for another.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>to fear the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>depart from evil,</hi> are phraſes which the Scripture uſeth in a very great latitude, to expreſs to us <hi>the ſum of Religion, and the whole of our duty.</hi> And becauſe the large uſage of theſe phraſes is to be the foundation of my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59944:25"/>diſcourſe, I ſhall for the farther clearing of this matter endeavour to ſhew theſe two things:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That 'tis very uſual in the Language of Scripture to expreſs the <hi>whole of Religion</hi> by theſe and ſuch like phraſes.</item>
               <item>2. The particular fitneſs of theſe two phraſes to deſcribe Religion.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. It is very uſual in the Language of Scripture to expreſs the <hi>whole of Religion</hi> by ſome eminent principle or part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>The great Principles of Religion are <hi>knowledge, faith, remembrance, love, and fear;</hi> by all which the Scripture uſeth to expreſs the <hi>whole duty of</hi> man.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> by the <hi>knowledge, remembrance</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> of God. Religion is called <hi>The knowledge of the holy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 30.3. Jer. 10.25.</note> And wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>know not God.</hi> So likewiſe, by the <hi>fear of the Lord,</hi> frequently in this Book of <hi>Job,</hi> and in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Proverbs.</hi> And <hi>Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another.</hi> And the <hi>fear of God</hi> is expreſly ſaid to be the ſum of Religion,<note place="margin">Eccl. 12.13.</note> 
               <hi>Fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole of man:</hi> And on the contrary, the wicked are deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>have not the fear of God before their eyes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 36.1.</note> And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59944:26"/>ſo likewiſe by the remembrance of <hi>God Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy Creator in the days of thy youth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 12.1.</note> that is, enter upon a religious courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: And on the contrary, the character of the wicked is, that <hi>they forget God; The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 9.17.</note> 
               <hi>and all the Nations that forget God.</hi> In the <hi>New Teſtament, Religion</hi> is uſually expreſſed by <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>love</hi> of them. Hence it is, that true Chriſtians are ſo frequently called <hi>believers,</hi> and wicked and ungodly men <hi>unbelievers,</hi> And that good men are deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>love God, all things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good to them that love God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ro. 8.28. Eph. 6.24.</note> and <hi>ſuch as love the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Now the reaſon why theſe are put for the <hi>whole of Religion,</hi> is, becauſe the <hi>belief,</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>remembrance,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> of God, are ſuch powerfull principles, and have ſo great an influence upon men to make them Religious, that where any one of theſe really is, all the reſt, together with the true and genuine effects of them, are ſuppoſed to be.</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe the ſum of all Religion is often expreſſed by ſome <hi>eminent part</hi> of it; which will explain the ſecond phraſe here in the Text, <hi>departing from evil.</hi> The <hi>worſhip of God</hi> is an <hi>eminent part</hi> of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59944:26"/>
               <hi>Religion;</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is often in Scripture expreſſed by <hi>ſeeking God,</hi> and <hi>calling upon his Name,</hi> is a chief part of Religious worſhip. Hence Religion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>ſeeking God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6</note> 
               <hi>He is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek, him:</hi> and by <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon his name,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2.21</note> 
               <hi>Whoſoever calleth upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And ſo by <hi>coming to God,</hi> and by <hi>departing from evil.</hi> In this fallen ſtate of man Religion begins with <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>converſion,</hi> the two oppoſite terms of which, are <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Sin:</hi> Hence it is that Religion is deſcribed ſometimes by <hi>coming to God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6</note> 
               <hi>He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to God, muſt believe that he is,</hi> that is, no man can be religious, unleſs he believe there is a God;<note place="margin">Iſ. 59.15.</note> ſometimes by <hi>departing from ſin, And he that departeth from evil, maketh himſelf a prey:</hi> that is, ſuch was the bad ſtate of thoſe times of which the Prophet there complains that no man could be religious but he was in danger of being perſecuted.</p>
            <p n="2">II. For the fitneſs of theſe two phraſes to deſcribe Religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt, <hi>[the fear of the Lord]</hi> The fitneſs of this phraſe will appear, if we conſider how great an influence the fear of God hath upon men to make them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59944:27"/>religious. Fear is a paſſion that is moſt deeply rooted in our natures, and flows immediately from that Principle of ſelf-preſervation which God hath planted in every man. Every one deſires his own preſervation and happineſs, and therefore hath a natural dread and horrour of every thing that can deſtroy his Being, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his happineſs. And the greateſt <hi>danger</hi> is from the greateſt <hi>power,</hi> and that is <hi>omnipotency.</hi> So that <hi>the fear of God</hi> is an inward acknowledgment of a holy and juſt Being, which is armed with an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and irreſiſtible power; God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hid in every Man's Conſcience a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret awe and dread of his infinite power, and eternal juſtice. Now <hi>fear</hi> being ſo intimate to our natures, it is the ſtrongeſt bond of Laws, and the great ſecurity of our duty.</p>
            <p>There are two bridles or reſtraints which God hath put upon humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>fear. Shame is</hi> the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and hath place onely in thoſe in whom there are ſome remainders of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. <hi>Fear</hi> is the ſtronger, and works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all who love themſelves and deſire their own preſervation. Therefore in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate of mankind, <hi>fear</hi> is that paſſion which hath the greateſt power
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59944:27"/>over us, and by which God and his Laws take the ſureſt hold of us: Our <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> are not ſo apt to be wrought upon by the repreſentation of vertue, and the promiſes of reward and happineſs, as our <hi>fear</hi> is from the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Divine diſpleaſure. For though we have loſt in a great meaſure the guſt and reliſh of true happineſs, yet we ſtill retain a quick ſenſe of pain and miſery. So that fear relies upon a natural love of our ſelves, and is complicated with a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſire of our own preſervation. And therefore Religion uſually makes its firſt entrance into us by this paſſion; hence perhaps it is that <hi>Solomon</hi> more than once <hi>calls the fear of the Lord the beginning of wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the Second phraſe <hi>[departing from evil]</hi> the fitneſs of it to expreſs the <hi>whole duty of man,</hi> will appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the neceſſary connexion that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the negative and poſitive part of our duty. He that is carefull to avoid all ſin will ſincerely endeavour to perform his duty. For the ſoul of man is an active principle, and will be employed one way or other, it will be doing ſomething; if a man abſtain from evil, he will do good. Now there being ſuch a ſtrait connexion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59944:28"/>between theſe, <hi>the whole of our duty</hi> may be expreſſed by either of them; but moſt fitly by <hi>departing from evil,</hi> becauſe that is the firſt part of our duty. Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in the forſaking of ſin:
<q>
                  <l>Virtus eſt vitium fugere, &amp; ſapientia prima</l>
                  <l>Stultitia caruiſſe —</l>
                  <l>Vertue begins in the forſaking of vice; and the firſt part of wiſedom is not to be a fool.</l>
               </q> And therefore the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions theſe parts of our duty, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly put <hi>departing from evil</hi> firſt; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from evil and do good.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 34.14 &amp; 37.27. Iſ. 1.16, 17. &amp; 55.7. Eph. 4.23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>Ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well. Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord.</hi> We are firſt to <hi>put off the old man which is corrupt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to deceitful luſts,</hi> and then <hi>to be renewed in the ſpirit of our minds, and to put on the new man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.11.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Let him eſchew evil and do good.</hi> To all which I may add this farther conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that the Law of God contained in the ten Commandments, conſiſting moſtly of prohibitions, (<hi>Thou ſhalt not</hi> doe ſuch or ſuch a'thing) our obſervance of it is moſt fitly expreſſed by <hi>departing from evil,</hi> which yet includes obedience like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the poſitive Precepts implied in thoſe Prohibitions.</p>
            <p>Having thus explain'd the <hi>Words,</hi> I come
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59944:28"/>now to conſider the <hi>Propoſition</hi> contain'd in them, which is this:</p>
            <p>That <hi>Religion is the beſt knowledge and wiſedom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſhall endeavour to make good theſe three ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>By a direct proof of it.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>By ſhewing on the contrary the folly and ignorance of irreligion and wickedneſs.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>By vindicating Religion from thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon imputations which ſeem to charge it with ignorance or imprudence.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I begin with the direct proof of this: And becauſe Religion comprehends two things, the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Principles</hi> of it, and <hi>a ſuitable life and practice;</hi> (the firſt of which being <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> may more properly be called <hi>knowledge;</hi> and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe 'tis <hi>practical,</hi> may be called <hi>wiſedom</hi> or <hi>prudence</hi>) therefore I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour diſtinctly to prove theſe two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That Religion is the beſt knowledge.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That 'tis the trueſt wiſdom.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>That it is the beſt knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The knowledge of Religion commends its ſelf to us upon theſe two accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis the knowledge of thoſe things which are in themſelves moſt excellent.</p>
            <p>Of thoſe things which are moſt uſefull and neceſſary for us to know.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59944:29"/>
            <p>Firſt, It is the beſt knowledge, becauſe it is the knowledge of thoſe things which are in themſelves moſt <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to be known;</hi> and thoſe are <hi>God,</hi> and our <hi>duty. God</hi> is the ſum and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all perfection. It is delightfull to know the <hi>Creatures,</hi> becauſe there are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular excellencies ſcatter'd and diſpers'd among them which are ſome ſhadows of the Divine perfections: But in <hi>God</hi> all perfections in their higheſt degree and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation meet together and are united. How much more delightfull then muſt it needs be to fix our minds upon ſuch an object in which there is nothing but <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>brightneſs,</hi> what is <hi>amiable,</hi> and what is <hi>excellent;</hi> what will <hi>raviſh our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and raiſe our wonder, pleaſe us</hi> and <hi>aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> us at once; And that the finite mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and capacity of our underſtandings is not able to take in and comprehend the infinite perfections of God, this indeed ſhews the excellency of the object, but doth not altogether take away the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulneſs of the knowledge. For as it is pleaſant to the Eye to have an endleſs proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, ſo is it ſome pleaſure to a finite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to view unlimited excellencies which have no ſhore or bounds, though it cannot comprehend them. There is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59944:29"/>in admiration; and this is that which properly cauſeth admiration, when we diſcover a great deal in an object which we underſtand to be excellent, and yet we ſee we know not how much more beyond that, which our underſtandings cannot fully reach and comprehend.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>knowledge of God</hi> in his <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>perfections</hi> is excellent and deſirable, ſo likewiſe to know him in thoſe glorious manifeſtations of himſelf <hi>in the works of Creation and Providence;</hi> and above all, in that ſtupendious work of the <hi>Redemption</hi> of the world by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which was ſuch a miſtery, and ſo excellent a piece of knowledge that <hi>the Angels</hi> are ſaid to <hi>deſire to pry into it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And as the <hi>knowledge of God</hi> is excellent, ſo likewiſe of <hi>our Duty</hi> which is nothing elſe but <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> which are the image of God, a conformity to the nature and will of God, and an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Excellencies and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſo far as we are capable: For to know our duty is to know what it is to be like God in <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>pity,</hi> and <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and clemency,</hi> in <hi>pardoning injuries, and paſſing by provocations;</hi> in <hi>juſtice and righteouſneſs,</hi> in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> and in a hatred and deteſtation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59944:30"/>of theſe: In a word, it is to know what is the good and acceptable will of God, what it is that he loves and delights in and is pleaſed withall, and would have us to do in order to our perfection and our happineſs. It is deſervedly accounted a piece of excellent knowledge to know the <hi>laws of the Land,</hi> and the <hi>cuſtoms of the Countrey</hi> we live in, and the <hi>will of the Prince</hi> we live under: How much more, to know the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Laws of eternity,</hi> thoſe immutable and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal rules of juſtice and righteouſneſs; to know the will and pleaſure of the great Monarch and univerſal King of the World, and the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of that <hi>Countrey</hi> where we muſt live for ever? This made <hi>David</hi> to admire the Law of God at that ſtrange rate, and to advance the knowledge of it above all other knowledge, <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.96.</note> but thy commandment is exceeding broad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, 'Tis the <hi>knowledge</hi> of thoſe things which are moſt <hi>uſefull</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> for us to know. The <hi>goodneſs</hi> of every thing is meaſured by its <hi>end</hi> and <hi>uſe,</hi> and that's the beſt thing which ſerves the beſt end and purpoſe; and the more neceſſary any thing is to ſuch an end, the better it is: So that the beſt knowledge is that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59944:30"/>which is of greateſt uſe and neceſſity to us in order to our <hi>great end,</hi> which is <hi>eternal happineſs,</hi> and the <hi>ſalvation of our Souls.</hi> Curious ſpeculations, and the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things that are impertinent to us, and do not concern us, nor ſerve to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our happineſs, are but a more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ingenious ſort of idleneſs, a more pardonable and creditable kind of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. That Man that doth not know thoſe things which are of uſe and neceſſity for him to know is but an ignorant man, whatever he may know beſides. Now the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of our <hi>duty,</hi> is of the greateſt uſefulneſs and neceſſity to us in order to our happineſs. It's of abſolute neceſſity that we ſhould know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in order to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happy; <hi>This is life eternal</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.3</note> the onely way to it) <hi>to know thee the onely true God, and him whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is neceſſary alſo in order to our happineſs to know our <hi>duty:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis neceſſary for us to do it, and it is impoſſible to do it except we know it.</p>
            <p>So that whatſoever other knowledge a man may be endued withall, he is but an ignorant perſon who doth not know God, the Author of his being, the preſerver and protector of his life, his Soveraign,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59944:31"/>and his Judge, the giver of every good and perfect gift, his ſureſt refuge in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his beſt friend or worſt enemy, the preſent ſupport of his life, his hopes in death, his future happineſs, and his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever: who does not know his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, the duty that he owes him, and the way to pleaſe <hi>him</hi> who can make him happy or miſerable for ever: who doth not know the Lord Jeſus Chriſt who is <hi>the way, the truth, and the life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a man by a vaſt and imperious mind, <hi>and a heart large as the ſand upon the Sea-ſhore,</hi> (as it is ſaid of <hi>Solomon</hi>) could command all the knowledge of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>things;</hi> could attain to a maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in all Languages, and ſound the depths of all Arts and Sciences, meaſure the earth and the heavens, and tell the ſtars, and declare their order and motions; could diſcourſe of the intereſts of all States, the intrigues of all Courts, the reaſon of all Civil laws and conſtitutions, and give an account of the Hiſtory of all ages; could ſpeak of trees, <hi>from the Cedar-tree that is in Lebanon, even unto the Hyſop that ſprings out of the wall; and of beaſts alſo and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fiſhes:</hi> and yet ſhould in the mean time, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the knowledge of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59944:31"/>and his <hi>duty;</hi> all this would be but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent vanity, and a more glittering kind of Ignorance; and ſuch a man (like the Philoſopher, who whilſt he was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing upon the ſtars, fell into the ditch) would but <hi>ſapienter deſcendere in infernum</hi> be undone with all this knowledge, and with a great deal of wiſdom go down to Hell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>That to be religious is the trueſt wiſdom,</hi> and that likewiſe upon two accounts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Becauſe it is to be wiſe for our ſelves.</item>
               <item>2. It is to be wiſe as to our main intereſt and concernment.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis to be wiſe for our ſelves.</hi> There's an expreſſion, <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. <hi>He that is wiſe is profitable to himſelf;</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.12. <hi>If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf:</hi> intimating that wiſdom regards a man's own intereſt and advantage, and that he is not a wiſe man that doth not take care of himſelf and his own concernments, according to that of Old <hi>Ennius, nequicquam ſapere ſapientem, qui ſibi ipſi prodeſſe non quiret,</hi> That man hath but an empty title of Wiſdom and is not really vviſe vvho is not wiſe for himſelf. As <hi>ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> is the firſt principle of <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo care of our ſelves and our ovvn intereſt is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59944:32"/>the firſt part of <hi>wiſdom.</hi> He that is wiſe in the affairs and concernments of other men, but careleſs and negligent of his own, that man may be ſaid to be buſie, but he is not wiſe: he is employed indeed, but not ſo as a wiſe man ſhould be: Now this is the <hi>Wiſdom of Religion,</hi> that it directs a man to a care of his own proper intereſt and concernment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is to be wiſe as to our main intereſt.</hi> Our chief end and higheſt intereſt is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: And this is <hi>happineſs</hi> to be freed from all (if it may) however from the greateſt evils; and to enjoy (if it may be) all good, however the chiefeſt. <hi>To be happy</hi> is not onely to be freed from the <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>diſeaſes</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> but from <hi>anxiety</hi> and <hi>vexation</hi> of <hi>ſpirit:</hi> not onely to enjoy the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> but <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and tranquillity of <hi>mind. To be happy,</hi> is not onely to be ſo for a little while, but as long as may be; and if it be poſſible, for ever. Now <hi>Religion</hi> deſigns our <hi>greateſt and longeſt happineſs;</hi> it aims at a freedom from the greateſt evils, and to bring us to the poſſeſſion and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greateſt good. For Religion wiſely conſiders that men have <hi>immortal ſpirits,</hi> which as they are <hi>ſpirits</hi> are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a pleaſure and happineſs diſtinct
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59944:32"/>from that of our <hi>bodies</hi> and our <hi>ſenſes;</hi> and becauſe they are <hi>immortal,</hi> are capable of an everlaſting happineſs. Now our <hi>ſouls</hi> being the beſt part of our ſelves, and <hi>eternity</hi> being infinitely the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable duration, the greateſt <hi>wiſdom</hi> is to ſecure the intereſt of our <hi>ſouls</hi> and of <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> though it be with loſs and to the prejudice of our <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>inferior</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. Therefore <hi>Religion</hi> directs us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſecure <hi>inward peace</hi> than <hi>outward eaſe,</hi> to be more carefull to avoid <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi> and <hi>intolerable torment</hi> than <hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>light afflictions which are but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> to court <hi>the favour</hi> of <hi>God</hi> more than the <hi>friendſhip</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> and not ſo much <hi>to fear them that can kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do, as him who after he hath kill'd, can deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell:</hi> In a word, our <hi>main intereſt</hi> is to be <hi>as happy as we can,</hi> and <hi>as long as is poſſible;</hi> and if we be caſt into ſuch circumſtances, that we muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in part and for a time or elſe wholly and always miſerable, the <hi>beſt wiſdom</hi> is to chuſe the <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>moſt laſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> but the <hi>leaſt</hi> and <hi>ſhorteſt miſery.</hi> Upon this account <hi>Religion</hi> prefers thoſe <hi>pleaſures which flow from the preſence of God for evermore,</hi> infinitely before the <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59944:33"/>pleaſures</hi> of this world, and is much more carefull to avoid <hi>eternal miſery</hi> than <hi>preſent ſufferings.</hi> This is the <hi>wiſdom of Religion,</hi> that upon conſideration of the whole and caſting up all things together <hi>it does adviſe and lead us to our beſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Second</hi> way of <hi>confirmation</hi> ſhall be by endeavouring to ſhew the ignorance and folly of irreligion. Now all that are irreligious are ſo upon one of theſe two accounts: Either, <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe they do not believe the foundations and principles of Religion, as <hi>the exiſtence of God, the immortality of the ſoul,</hi> and <hi>future rewards:</hi> or elſe, <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe though they do in ſome ſort believe theſe things, yet they live contrary to this their belief; and of this kind are the far greateſt part of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. The <hi>firſt</hi> ſort are guilty of that which we call <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> of <hi>practicall Atheiſm.</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew the Ignorance and Folly of both theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Speculative Atheiſm</hi> is <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> and that upon theſe <hi>Five</hi> accounts. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>it gives no tolerable account of the exiſtence of the world.</hi> 2. Nor <hi>does it give any reaſonable account of the univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of mankind in this apprehenſion,</hi> That
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59944:33"/>there is a God. 3. <hi>It requires more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for things than they are capable of.</hi> 4. <hi>The Atheiſt pretends to know that which no man can know.</hi> 5. <hi>Atheiſm contradicts it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Becauſe <hi>it gives no tolerable account of the exiſtence of the world.</hi> One of the greateſt difficulties that lies in the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt's way is, upon his own ſuppoſition <hi>that there is no God,</hi> to give a likely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the exiſtence of the world. We ſee this vaſt frame of the World, and an innumerable multitude of creatures in it, all which we who believe a God attribute to <hi>him</hi> as the Author of them. For a <hi>being</hi> ſuppos'd of infinite <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>wiſedom</hi> and <hi>power</hi> is a very likely cauſe of theſe things. What more likely to make this vaſt world, to ſtretch forth the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, and to form theſe and all things in them of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, than infinite <hi>power?</hi> What more likely to communicate Being and ſo many degrees of happineſs to ſo many ſeveral ſorts of creatures, than infinite <hi>goodneſs?</hi> What more likely to contrive this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble frame of the Univerſe and all the creatures in it, each of them ſo perfect in their kind and all of them ſo fitted to each other and to the whole, than infinite
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59944:34"/>
               <hi>counſel</hi> and <hi>wiſedom?</hi> This ſeems to be no unreaſonable account.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee now what account the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> gives of theſe things. If there be no God there are but theſe <hi>two</hi> ways ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable for the world to be. Either it muſt be ſaid, That not onely the Matter but alſo the <hi>Frame</hi> of this world is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and that as to the main things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways were as they are without any firſt cauſe of their being; which is the way of the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Atheiſt; (thoſe I mean, who proceed upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s ſuppoſition of the eternity of the world, but yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it to be from God, which he expreſly aſſerts:) Or elſe the <hi>matter</hi> of the world being ſuppoſed to be eternal and of it ſelf, the original of this vaſt and beautifull <hi>frame</hi> muſt be aſcribed morely to <hi>chance,</hi> and the caſual concourſe of the parts of matter; which is the way of the <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Atheiſt. But neither of theſe ways gives a tolerable account of the exiſtence of the world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall firſt conſider the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of thoſe whom for diſtinction ſake I call the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Atheiſts, which is this; That not only the matter but alſo the <hi>frame</hi> of the world is eternal, and that as to the main it was always as it is, of it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59944:34"/>ſelf; and that there hath been from all eternity a ſucceſſion of men and other creatures without any firſt cauſe of their being.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to be very hard, and if that would do any good might be juſt matter of complaint, that we are fallen into ſo prophane and ſceptical an age which takes a pleaſure and a pride in unravilling almoſt all the received principles both of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reaſon: So that we are put ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to prove thoſe things which can hardly be made plainer than they are of themſelves. And ſuch almoſt are theſe Principles, <hi>That God is,</hi> and <hi>That all things were made by him;</hi> which by reaſon of the bold cavils of perverſe and unreaſonable men we are now a-days put to defend.</p>
            <p>That ſomething is of it ſelf is evident, becauſe we ſee things are. And the things that we ſee muſt either have had ſome firſt cauſe of their being, or have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and of themſelves. One of theſe two is unavoidable.</p>
            <p>So that the controverſie between us and this ſort of Atheiſt comes to this; Which is the more credible opinion, that the world was never made nor had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but always was as it is, and that there hath been from all eternity a ſucceſſion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59944:35"/>of men and other creatures without any firſt cauſe of their being: or, that there was from all eternity ſuch a <hi>being</hi> as we conceive <hi>God</hi> to be, infinite in power, goodneſs and wiſedom, which made us and all other things; The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I ſhall ſhew to be altogether incredible, and the <hi>latter</hi> to have all the credibility and evidence of which a thing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable, and ſuch evidence as is ſufficient to convince any impartial and conſiderate man.</p>
            <p>Now in comparing the probabilities of things, that we may know on which ſide the advantage lies, theſe two conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are of great moment, What the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are on each ſide, and what the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. For if there be fair proofs on the one ſide, and none at all on the other, and if the moſt preſſing difficulties be on that ſide on which there are no proofs: this is ſufficient to render <hi>one</hi> opinion very credible and the <hi>other</hi> altogether incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>two things</hi> therefore I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make good, in the matter that is now under our conſideration. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there are fair proofs on our ſide, and as convincing as the nature of the things is capable of; but that there is no pretence
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59944:35"/>of proof on the other. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the ſide on which there is no proof is incumbred with the greateſt difficulties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there are fair proofs on our ſide, and as convincing as the nature of the thing is capable of; but that there is no pretence of proof on the other.</p>
            <p>This Queſtion, <hi>Whether the world was created and had a beginning, or not?</hi> is a queſtion concerning <hi>an ancient matter of fact,</hi> which can onely be decided theſe two ways; by <hi>teſtimony,</hi> and by <hi>probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of reaſon. Teſtimony,</hi> is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal argument in a matter of this nature, and if fair <hi>probabilities of reaſon</hi> concur with it this argument hath all the ſtrength it can have: Now both theſe are clearly on the affirmative ſide of the queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the world was created, and had a beginning.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> of which there be two kinds, <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Divine teſtimony,</hi> as ſuch, is not proper to be us'd in this cauſe conſidering the occaſion of the preſent debate: For that would be to beg the firſt and main que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion now in controverſie, which is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a God or not? which a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from God does ſuppoſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be brought for the proof
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59944:36"/>of it. 'Tis true indeed that thoſe effects of Divine Power, I mean miracles which will prove a divine teſtimony to an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, will as well prove the being of a God to an Atheiſt; But when we diſpute againſt thoſe who deny a God no teſtimony ought to be preſum'd to be from God, but muſt be prov'd to be ſo. And whatever argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proves that will alſo prove that there is a God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humane teſtimonies</hi> are of two ſorts; <hi>univerſal tradition,</hi> and <hi>written Hiſtory.</hi> Both theſe are plainly and beyond diſpute on our ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is an <hi>univerſal tradition</hi> concerning the beginning of the world, and that it was made by God. And for the evidence of this we have the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Tradition of the moſt <hi>ancient</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have likewiſe a moſt <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> and credible <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the beginning of the world; I mean the Hiſtory of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> with which no Book in the world in point of antiquity can contend. I ſhall
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59944:37"/>not now go about to ſtrengthen my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by pleading the Divine authority of this Book; for which yet I could offer good evidence, if that were proper to the matter hand. It is ſufficient to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> have the ordinary credit of an Hiſtorian given him, which none in reaſon can deny him, he being ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the moſt ancient of the Heathen Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, and the antiquity of his writings never queſtioned by any of them, as <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>

                  <hi>L.</hi> 1. contra <hi>Appion.</hi>
               </note> aſſures us.</p>
            <p>Now this Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us a particular account of the beginning of the world, and of the creation of it by God. Which aſſertion of his is agreeable to the moſt ancient <hi>Writers</hi> among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> whether <hi>Poets</hi> or <hi>Hiſtorians.</hi> And ſeveral of the main parts of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hiſtory, as concerning the <hi>Floud</hi> and the <hi>firſt Fathers</hi> of the <hi>ſeveral Nations</hi> of the World (of which he gives a particular account, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.) do very well accord with the moſt ancient accounts of <hi>Prophane</hi> Hiſtory. And I do not know, whether any thing ought more to recommend the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> to a humane belief, than the eaſie and credible account which he gives of the original of the World, and of the firſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of it.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59944:38"/>
            <p>As to the account of ancient times, both the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> and <hi>Chaldean</hi> accounts, which are pretended by ſome to be ſo vaſtly different from that of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> may for all that be, near the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, eaſily reconcil'd with it<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſleet</hi>'s <hi>Orig. Sac.</hi> where this is fully made out.</note>; if we do but admit what <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> and <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> very credible perſons and diligent ſearchers into ancient Books, do moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſure us, <hi>viz.</hi> that both thoſe <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> did anciently reckon months for years. And the account of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> is not hard to be reconcil'd with that of the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> Now in ſo nice and obſcure a matter, as the account of ancient times is, it ought to ſatisfie any fair and reaſonable enquirer if they can be brought any whit near one another.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>univerſal Tradition</hi> and the moſt <hi>ancient Hiſtory</hi> in the world are clearly on our ſide. And if they be, one can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh a more convincing argument. For if the world and conſequently mankind had a beginning, there is all the reaſon in the world to expect theſe two things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that there ſhould be an <hi>univerſal Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> concerning this matter; becauſe it was the moſt memorable thing that could be tranſmitted to poſterity. And this was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be done, if mankind ſprang from one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59944:38"/>common <hi>root</hi> and <hi>original<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> from whence this <hi>Tradition</hi> would naturally be univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diffus'd. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it may with the ſame reaſon be expected, that ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a <hi>thing</hi> ſhould be recorded in the moſt ancient <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Now both theſe have accordingly happened. But then on the other hand, if the world was eternal and had no beginning there could be no real ground for ſuch a <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> And if ſuch a Tradition were at any time endeavoured to be ſet on foot, it is not eaſie to imagine how it ſhould at firſt gain entertainment, but much more difficult to conceive how ever it ſhould come to be <hi>univerſally</hi> propagated. For upon the <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> of thoſe who hold the eternity of the world, the world was always peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled; and if ſo, there could be no common head or ſpring from whence ſuch a <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> would naturally derive it ſelf into all parts of the world. So that unleſs all the world was ſometime of one <hi>language,</hi> and under one <hi>Government</hi> (which it never was that we know of ſince it was peopled) no endeavour and induſtry could make ſuch a Tradition common.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that this Tradition began after ſome univerſal deluge, out of which poſſibly but one family might eſcape, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59944:39"/>that poſſibly too of barbarous people; from whom any fond and groundleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit might ſpring and afterwards ſpread it ſelf as mankind encreas'd. This I ſhall have occaſion to conſider in a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place. In the mean time I have ſhewn, even from the acknowledgment of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> himſelf, that there was anciently ſuch a Tradition concerning the beginning of the world. Nay, if we may believe him, he himſelf was the very firſt aſſerter of the eternity of the world. For he<note n="*" place="margin">De Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo. <hi>l.</hi> 1. c. 10.</note> ſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>That all the Philoſophers that were before him, did hold that the world was made.</hi> Thus much for the <hi>firſt</hi> kind of <hi>proof</hi> this matter is capable of, namely, <hi>teſtimony.</hi>

                  <l>Non alias alii quoque res cecinere Poetae?</l>
               </q> i. e. <hi>If the world had no beginning, how is it that the Greek Poets</hi> (the moſt ancient of their <hi>Writers</hi>) <hi>mention nothing higher than the</hi> Theban <hi>war, and the deſtruction of</hi> Troy? Were there from all eternity no memorable actions done till about that time? Or had mankind no way till of late to record them and propagate the memory of them to poſterity? It is much if men were from eternity, that they ſhould not find out the way of writing all that <hi>long</hi> duration, which had paſt before that Time. Sure he was a fortunate man indeed, who after men had been eternally ſo dull as not to find it out, had the luck at laſt to hit upon it.</p>
            <p>But it may be, the famous actions of former times were always recorded, but that the memorials of them have been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times loſt by univerſal deluges, which have now and then happen'd and ſwept all away, except (it may be) two or three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that have eſcap'd and begun the world again upon a new ſcore. This is the onely refuge that the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> hath to fly to, when he is preſt with this and the like arguments. But he cannot poſſibly eſcape this way. For theſe univerſal inundations
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59944:40"/>muſt either be <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>ſupernatural.</hi> If they be <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> (as any man that conſiders well the frame of the world, and how hard it is to give a natural reaſon of them, would be enclin'd to think) then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is eaſie to conceive how a few of mankind, and no more, ſhould eſcape: Becauſe this will depend upon the pleaſure of that ſuperiour Being which is ſuppoſed ſupernaturally to order theſe things. But this is to yield what we have all this while contended for, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a God. But if they be <hi>natural,</hi> which the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> muſt ſay, then there is nothing to reſtrain them from a total deſtruction, not onely of mankind, but of all the beaſts of the earth. This the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> cannot deny, not onely to be very poſſible, but exceeding proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; becauſe he grants it to have come ſo near the matter, that but very few eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd, and no doubt with great difficulty. Now it is the greateſt wonder in the world, that a thing (according to their own ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) ſo likely to happen, ſhould never have fallen out in an infinite dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Will any man have the face to ſay that a thing is likely which did never yet happen from all eternity? One would think that not onely whatever is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but whatever can poſſibly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59944:40"/>ſhould be brought about in that ſpace: So that if mankind had been from eternity it had in all probability, I had almoſt ſaid, been deſtroyed from all eternity, but I may confidently ſay, long ſince ruin'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another <hi>probability</hi> of the worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is, the account which we have of the <hi>original of Learning and the moſt uſeful Arts</hi> in ſeveral parts of the world. Now if the world had been eternal, theſe in all likelihood would have been found out, and generally ſpread long ago and beyond the memory of all ages. There are ſome <hi>Arts</hi> indeed that are peculiarly convenient to ſome particular Nations; and others that are onely ſerviceable to the humour and faſhion of one or more ages. Theſe are not likely to ſpread, and they may come in, and go out, and return again as often as there is occaſion. But thoſe which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſefull to mankind in all times and places, if they were once found out (and who would not think they ſhould in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal duration?) it is not imaginable but that they ſhould have been ſpread innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ages ſince: Nor can any man give a good reaſon how they ſhould ever be loſt, but by ſome ſuch accident as an univerſal deluge, which has been ſpoken to already. But now on the contrary, the beginnings
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59944:41"/>of <hi>Learning</hi> and of the moſt uſeful <hi>Arts</hi> in ſeveral Nations, is very well known. And I add farther, that where-ever Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Civil Arts have come this <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> concerning the <hi>beginning of the world</hi> hath been moſt vigorous, and aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the greatneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe are ſome of the chief Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on our ſide; which being taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and in their united force, have a great deal of conviction in them.

That there are fair proofs on our ſide, and as convincing as the nature of the thing is capable of; but that there is no pretence or proof on the other.</hi> I proceed therefore to the</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59944:42"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Conſideration, That the moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing difficulties are on that ſide on which there is no proof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe who deny a God, and hold the world to have been eternal and of it ſelf, have onely two things to object againſt us: The difficulties that there are in the <hi>notion of a God, and in making the world of nothing.</hi> To the <hi>firſt</hi> I anſwer: That we attribute nothing to God that hath any repugnancy or contradiction in it. <hi>Power, wiſedom, goodneſs, juſtice</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> have no repugnancy in them to our reaſon; becauſe we own theſe Perfections to be in ſome degree in our ſelves; and therefore they may be in the higheſt degree that is poſſible in another. The <hi>eternity</hi> of God and his <hi>immenſity,</hi> and his <hi>being of himſelf,</hi> how difficult ſoever they may be to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, yet theſe perfections muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be ſomewhere; and therefore they may as well, nay much better, be aſcrib'd to God, in whom we ſuppoſe all other perfections to meet, than to any thing elſe. And as for God's being a <hi>ſpirit,</hi> whatever difficulty there may be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the notion of a <hi>ſpirit,</hi> yet the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> muſt grant the thing, that there is a being or principle really diſtinct from matter; or elſe ſhew how meer
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59944:42"/>matter, which is confeſſed by themſelves to be void of ſenſe and underſtanding, and to move neceſſarily, can produce any thing that has ſenſe, underſtanding and liberty. As to the <hi>other</hi> difficulty, of <hi>making the world of nothing,</hi> I ſhall onely ſay this: that though it ſignifie an inconceivable exceſs of power, yet there can no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction be ſhewn in it. And it is every whit as eaſie to conceive that ſomething ſhould be caus'd to be that was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as that any thing ſhould be of it ſelf; which yet muſt be granted on both ſides; and therefore this difficulty ought not to be objected by either.</p>
            <p>But then on the other ſide there are theſe <hi>two</hi> great and real difficulties. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That men generally have always believed the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the World had a beginning, and was made by God. Which is a ſtrong evidence that this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the exiſtence of the world is more natural, and of a more eaſie concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to humane underſtanding. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is very natural to conceive that every thing which is imperfect (as the world and all the creatures in it muſt be acknowledged in many reſpects to be) had ſome cauſe which produc'd it, ſuch as it is, and determin'd the bounds and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59944:43"/>limitss of its perfection: but that which is of it ſelf and without a cauſe, may be any thing, and have any perfection which does not imply a contradiction. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To aſſert mankind to have been of it ſelf, and without a cauſe, hath this invincible objection againſt it; that we plainly ſee every man to be from another. So that mankind is aſſerted to have no cauſe of its being, and yet every particular man muſt be acknowledged to have a father; which is every whit as abſurd in an infinite ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of men, as in any finite number of generations. It is more eaſie indeed to conceive how a conſtant and permanent being, ſuppoſe <hi>matter,</hi> ſhould always have been of it ſelf; and then that <hi>that</hi> ſhould be the foundation of infinite ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive changes and alterations: But an infinite ſucceſſion of the generations of men without any permanent foundation, is utterly unimaginable. If it be ſaid that the <hi>earth</hi> was always, and in time did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>men,</hi> and that they ever ſince have produc'd one another; this is to run into one great abſurdity of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> way, which ſhall be conſider'd in its proper place.</p>
            <p>And thus I have endeavour'd as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and briefly as the nature of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59944:43"/>would admit, to prove that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives of the exiſtence of the world, is moſt credible, and agreeable to the reaſon of mankind; and that this <hi>Firſt</hi> account which the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> gives of it, is altogether incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And now I expect after all this the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> will complain, that all that hath been ſaid does not amount to a <hi>ſtrict de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration</hi> of the thing. It may be ſo. And if the Atheiſt would undertake to <hi>demonſtrate</hi> the contrary, there might be ſome reaſon for this complaint. In the mean time I deſire to know whether when both ſides are agreed that the world is, and that it muſt either have its original from God, or have been always of it ſelf; and if it have been made evident, that on <hi>one ſide</hi> there are fair <hi>proofs</hi> both from <hi>teſtimony</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> and as convincing as the nature of the thing is capable of, and no pretence of proof on the <hi>other;</hi> and that the <hi>difficulties</hi> are moſt preſſing on that <hi>ſide</hi> which is deſtitute of proof; I ſay, if this have been made evident, I deſire to know whether this be not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter as ſatisfactory to a wiſe man as a <hi>demonſtration?</hi> For in this caſe there can be no doubt on which ſide the clear advantage of evidence lies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59944:44"/>which way a prudent man ought to determine aſſent.</p>
            <p>I come now in the <hi>Second</hi> place, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>other account</hi> which another ſort of <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> thoſe whom I call the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,</hi> do give of the exiſtence of the world. And 'tis this. They ſuppoſe the matter of which the world is conſtituted to be eternal and of it ſelf, and then an infinite empty ſpace for the infinite little parts of this matter (which they call <hi>Atomes</hi>) to move and play in; and that theſe being always in motion did after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite trials and encounters, without any counſel or deſign and without the diſpoſal and contrivance of any wiſe and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent being, at laſt by a lucky caſualty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle and ſettle themſelves in this beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and regular frame of the world which we now ſee. And that the Earth, being at firſt in its full vigour and fruitfulneſs, did then bring forth men and all other ſorts of living creatures as it does plants now.</p>
            <p>This is in ſhort the <hi>Epicurean</hi> account of the original of the world, which as abſurd as it is <hi>Lucretius</hi>

            <p>Thus he like a good <hi>Poet,</hi> but a very bad maker and contriver of the world. For I appeal to any man of reaſon whether any thing can be more unreaſonable, than obſtinately to impute an effect to chance which carries in the very face of it all the arguments and characters of a wiſe deſign, and contrivance? Was ever any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable work, in which there was required a great variety of parts and a regular and orderly diſpoſition of thoſe parts, done by chance? Will chance fit means to ends, and that in ten thouſand inſtances, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59944:45"/>not fail in any one? How often might a man after he had jumbled a ſet of letters in a bag, fling them out upon the ground before they would fall into an exact Poem, yea or ſo much as make a good diſcourſe in Proſe? And may not a little <hi>Book</hi> be as eaſily made by chance, as this great <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume</hi> of the world? How long might a man be in ſprinkling colours upon Canvas with a careleſs hand, before they would happen to make the exact Picture of a man? And is a man eaſier made by chance than his Picture? How long might twenty thouſand <hi>blind men,</hi> which ſhould be ſent out from the ſeveral remote parts of <hi>England,</hi> wander up and down before they would all meet upon <hi>Salisbury plains</hi> and fall into rank and file in the exact order of an Army? And yet this is much more eaſie to be imagined, than how the innumerable blind parts of matter ſhould rendezvous themſelves into a world. A man that ſees <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Seventh</hi>'s Chappel at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> might with as good reaſon maintain (yea with much better, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the vaſt difference betwixt that little ſtructure and the huge fabrick of the world) that it was never contrived or built by any man, but that the ſtones did by chance grow into thoſe curious
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59944:45"/>figures into which they ſeem to have been cut and graven; and that <hi>upon a time</hi> (as tales uſually begin) the materials of that building, the ſtone, morter, timber, iron, lead, and glaſs, happily met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and very fortunately rang'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into that delicate order in which we ſee them now ſo cloſe compacted that it muſt be a very great chance that parts them again. What would the world think of a man that ſhould advance ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion as this, and write a Book for it? If they would do him right, they ought to look upon him as mad: but yet with a little more reaſon than any man can have to ſay that the world was made by chance: or that the firſt men grew up out of the earth as plants do now. For can any thing be more ridiculous and againſt all reaſon, than to aſcribe the production of men to the firſt fruitfulneſs of the earth, without ſo much as one inſtance and experiment in any Age or Hiſtory to countenance ſo monſtrous a ſuppoſition? The thing is at firſt-ſight ſo groſs and palpable, that no diſcourſe about it can make it more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. And yet theſe ſhameful beggars of Principles, who give this precarious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the original of things, aſſume to themſelves to be the men of reaſon, the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59944:46"/>
               <hi>great wits</hi> of the world the onely <hi>cautious</hi> and wary perſons that hate to be impoſed upon, that muſt have convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for every thing, and can admit of nothing without a clear demonſtration for it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Speculative atheiſm</hi> is unreaſonable, becauſe it gives no reaſonable account of the <hi>univerſal conſent</hi> of mankind in this apprehenſion, <hi>that there is a God.</hi> That men do generally believe a God, and have done in all Ages, the preſent experience of the world and the records of former times do abundantly teſtify. Now how comes this perſwaſion to have gained ſo univerſal a poſſeſſion of the mind of man, and to have found ſuch general entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all Nations, even thoſe that are moſt barbarous? If there be no ſuch thing as God in the world, how comes it to paſs that this object doth continually encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our underſtandings? Whence is it that we are ſo perpetually haunted with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of a Deity, and followed with it wherever we go? If it be not natural to the mind of man, but proceeds from ſome accidental diſtemper of our underſtandings, how comes it to be ſo univerſal that no differences of age, or temper, or education can wear it out, and ſet any conſiderable
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59944:46"/>number of men free from it; Into what can we reſolve this ſtrong inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mankind to this error and miſtake? How come all Nations to be thus ſeduced? It is altogether unimaginable but that the reaſon of ſo univerſal a conſent in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ages of the world, and among all differences of perſons, ſhould be one and conſtant. But no one and conſtant reaſon of this can be given, but from the nature of man's mind and underſtanding which hath this notion of a Deity born with it and ſtamped upon it; or which is all one, is of ſuch a frame that in the free uſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it ſelf it will find out God: And what more reaſonable than to think, that if we be God's workmanſhip, he ſhould ſet this mark of himſelf upon all reaſonable creatures, that they may know to whom they belong, and may acknowledge the <hi>Author</hi> of their beings? This ſeems to be a credible and ſatisfactory account of ſo <hi>univerſal</hi> a <hi>conſent</hi> in this matter. But now what doth the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> reſolve this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? He is not at one with himſelf what account to give of it, nor can it be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he ſhould. For he that will over-look the true reaſon of a thing which uſually is but one, may eaſily find many falſe ones, error being infinite, But there are <hi>three</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59944:47"/>which he principally relies upon, <hi>fear, tradition,</hi> and <hi>policy of State.</hi> I ſhall briefly conſider theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He would make us believe that this apprehenſion of a God doth ſpring from an infinite <hi>jealouſie</hi> in the mind of man, and an endleſs fear of the worſt that may happen; according to that <hi>divine ſaying</hi> of the Poet, which he can never ſufficiently admire,
<q>Primum in orle Deos fecit timor,—</q>
               <hi>Fear firſt made Gods.</hi> So that it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on both ſides that the <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>a Deity</hi> doth univerſally poſſeſs the minds of men. Now the queſtion is, whether it be more likely that the exiſtence of a God ſhould be the cauſe of this fear, or that this fear ſhould be the cauſe why men imagine there is a God? if there be a God, who hath impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this image of himſelf upon the mind of Man, there's great reaſon why all men ſhould ſtand in awe of him: But if there be no God, it is not eaſie to conceive how fear ſhould create an univerſal confidence and aſſurance in men that there is one. For, whence ſhould this fear come? It muſt be either from without, from the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of others who firſt tell us there is ſuch a <hi>being</hi> and then our fear believes it, or elſe it muſt ariſe from within, from the nature of man which is apt to fanſie
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59944:47"/>dreadfull and terrible things. If from the ſuggeſtion of others who tell us ſo, the queſtion returns, who told <hi>them</hi> ſo? and will never be ſatisfied till the firſt Author of this report be found out. So that this account of <hi>fear</hi> reſolves it ſelf into <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which ſhall ſpoken to in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place. But if it be ſaid that this fear ariſeth from within, from the nature of man which is apt to imagine dreadfull things, this likewiſe is liable to inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difficulties. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The proper object of fear, is ſomething that is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that is, ſomething that threatens men with harm or danger; and that in God muſt either be power or juſtice; and ſuch an object as this fear indeed may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate: But Goodneſs and Mercy are eſſential to the notion of a God as well as power and juſtice: now how ſhould fear put men upon fanſying a being that is infinitely good and merciful? No man hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be afraid of ſuch a being, as ſuch. So that the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> muſt joyn another cauſe to fear, <hi>viz.</hi> hope, to enable men to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate this imagination of a God. And what would the product of theſe two contrary paſſions be? the imagination of a being which we ſhould fear would do us as much harm as we could hope it would do us
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59944:48"/>good; which would be <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> and which our reaſon would oblige us to lay aſide ſo ſoon as we have fanſied it, becauſe it would ſignifie juſt nothing. But, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> ſuppoſe fear alone could do it; how comes the mind of man to be ſubject to ſuch groundleſs and unreaſonable fears? The <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Atheiſt will ſay, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways was ſo; But this is to affirm, and not to give any account of a thing. The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurean</hi> Atheiſt, if he will ſpeak conſonant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to himſelf, muſt ſay that there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the original conſtitution of the firſt men ſuch a contexture of <hi>Atomes</hi> as doth naturally diſpoſe men to theſe panick fears; unleſs he will ſay that the firſt men when they grew out of the earth and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards broke looſe from their root, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves weak and naked and unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and meeting with ſeveral fierce Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtronger than themſelves, they were put into ſuch a fright as did a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper their underſtandings and let looſe their imaginations to endleſs ſuſpicions and unbounded jealouſies, which did at laſt ſettle in the conceit of an inviſible <hi>being</hi> infinitely powerful, and able to do them harm; and being fully poſſeſt with this apprehenſion (nothing being more ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than for crazed perſons to believe their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59944:48"/>own fancies) they became religious; and afterwards when mankind began to be propagated in the way of generation, then Religion obliged them to inſtill theſe <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> into their Children in their tender years that ſo they might make the greater impreſſion upon them; and this courſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been continued ever ſince the notion of a God hath been kept up in the world. This is very ſuitable to <hi>Epicurus</hi> his <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> of the original of men; But if any man think fit to ſay thus I cannot think it fit to confute him. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> whether men were from all eternity ſuch timorous and fancifull Creatures, or hapned to be made ſo in the firſt conſtitution of things, it ſeems however that this <hi>fear</hi> of a Deity hath a foundation in nature. And if it be natural, ought we not rather to conclude that there is ſome ground and reaſon for theſe <hi>fears,</hi> and that nature hath not plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in us to no purpoſe, than that they are vain and groundleſs? There is no principle that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (the great aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the eternity of the world) doth more frequently inculcate than this, <hi>That nature doeth nothing in vain;</hi> and the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> himſelf is forc'd to acknowledge (and ſo every man muſt who attentively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the frame of the world) That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59944:49"/>things were made by chance, yet they have happen'd as well as if the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wiſedom had the ordering and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them. And ſurely wiſedom would never have planted ſuch a vain principle as the fear of a Deity in the nature of man, if there had not been a God in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If <hi>fear</hi> be not a ſufficient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this univerſal conſent, the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> thinks it may very probably be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into <hi>univerſal Tradition.</hi> But this likewiſe is liable to great exception. For, whence came this Tradition? It muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſome time, it muſt have its original from ſome body; and it were very well worth our knowing who that man was that firſt raiſed this ſpirit which all the reaſon of mankind could never conjure down ſince. <hi>Where</hi> did he live, and <hi>when?</hi> In what <hi>Countrey,</hi> and in what <hi>Age</hi> of the world? <hi>What was his name, or his ſons name, that we may know him?</hi> This the Atheiſt can give no punctual account of: only he imagines it not improbable that ſome body long ago (no body knows when) beyond the memory of all Ages did ſtart ſuch a notion in the world and that it hath paſt for current ever ſince. But if this <hi>Tradition</hi> be granted ſo very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as to have been before all Books
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59944:49"/>and to be elder than any Hiſtory, it may for any thing any body can tell have been from the beginning; and then it is much more likely to be a notion which was bred in the mind of man and born with him, than a <hi>Tradition</hi> tranſmitted from hand to hand through all Generations; eſpecially if we conſider how many rude and barbarous Nations there are in the world which conſent in the opinion of a God, and yet have ſcarce any certain <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of any thing that was done among them but two or three Ages before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But if neither of theſe be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, he hath one way more; which although it ſignifie little to men of ſober and ſevere Reaſon, yet it very unhappily hits the jealous and ſuſpicious humour of the generality of men, who from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they have had of themſelves and others are very apt to ſuſpect that every body, but eſpecially their Superiours and Governours, have a deſign to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for their own ends. In ſhort, it is this: that this noiſe about a God is a mere State-Engine and a Politick device, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at firſt by ſome great Prince or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State, to keep People in awe and order. And if ſo, from hence (ſaith the Atheiſt) we may eaſily apprehend how
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59944:50"/>from ſuch an original it might be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propagated and become univerſally cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, having the ſtamp of publick autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon it. Beſides, that people have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been found eaſie to comply with the inclinations of their Prince. And from hence likewiſe we may ſee the reaſon why this notion had continued ſo long. For being found by experience to be ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an inſtrument of government we may be ſure it would always be cheriſhed and kept up.</p>
            <p>And now he triumphs, and thinks the buſineſs is very clear: Thus it was, ſome time or other, (moſt probably towards the beginning of the world, if it had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when all mankind was under one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Monarch) ſome great <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> ſet up this <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Deity,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>all people and Nations to fall down and worſhip it:</hi> And this being found a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful device to awe people into obedience to government it hath been continued to this day, and is like to laſt to the end of the world. To this fine Conjecture I have theſe four things to ſay:</p>
            <p>1. That all this is mere conjecture and ſuppoſition; <hi>he</hi> cannot bring the leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of proof or evidence for any one tittle of it.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59944:50"/>
            <p>2. This ſuppoſition grants the opinion of a God to conduce very much to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of government and order in the world; and conſequently to be very beneficial to mankind. So that the Atheiſt cannot but acknowledge that it is great pity that it ſhould not be true, and that it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt of mankind, if there were but probable Arguments for it, not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any ſlight reaſons againſt it; and to puniſh all thoſe who would ſeduce men to Atheiſm, as the great diſturbers of the world and peſts of humane Society.</p>
            <p>3. This ſuppoſition can have nothing of certainty in it unleſs this be true, <hi>that whoever makes a politick advantage of other mens principles ought to be preſumed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive thoſe principles into them,</hi> Whereas it is much more common (becauſe more eaſie) for men to ſerve their own ends of thoſe principles or opinions which they do not put into men but find there. So that if the queſtion of a God were to be decided by the probability of this conjecture, (which the Atheiſt applauds himſelf moſt in) it would be concluded in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; It being much more likely, ſince Politicians reap the advantages of obedience and a more ready ſubmiſſion to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from mens believing that there
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59944:51"/>is a God, that they found the minds of men prepoſſeſſed to their hands with the notion of a God, than that they planted it there.</p>
            <p>4. We have as much evidence of the contrary to this ſuppoſition as ſuch a thing is capable of, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was not an <hi>arcanum imperii,</hi> a <hi>ſecret</hi> of <hi>government</hi> to propagate the belief of a God among the people when the Governours themſelves knew it to be a cheat. For we find in the Hiſtories of all Ages of which we have any records, (and of other Ages we cannot poſſibly judge) that Princes have not been more ſecure from troubles of conſcience and the fears of Religion and the terrors of another world, (nay many of them more ſubject to theſe) than other men, as I could give many inſtances, and thoſe no mean ones: What made <hi>Caligula</hi> creep under the bed when it thunder'd? What made <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that great Maſter of the crafts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment complain ſo much of the grievous <hi>ſtings</hi> and <hi>laſhes</hi> he felt in his Conſcience? What made <hi>Cardinal Woolſey</hi> (that great Miniſter of State in our own Nation) to pour forth his ſoul in thoſe ſad words, <hi>Had I been as diligent to pleaſe my God as I have been to pleaſe my King, he would not have forſaken me now in my gray hairs?</hi> What reaſon for ſuch actions and ſpeeches, if
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59944:51"/>theſe great men had known that Religion was but a cheat? But if they knew nothing of this ſecret, I think we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the notion of a God did not come from the Court, that it was not the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Politicians and a juggle of State to cozen the people into obedience.</p>
            <p>And now from all this that hath been ſaid it ſeems to be very evident, that the general conſent of mankind in this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion <hi>that there is a God</hi> muſt in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be aſcribed to ſome more certain and univerſal cauſe than <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>tradition</hi> or <hi>State-policy, viz.</hi> to <hi>this</hi> that God himſelf hath wrought this image of himſelf upon the mind of man, and ſo woven it into the very frame of his being that (like <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> his Picture in <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Shield) it can never totally be defaced without the ruine of humane nature.</p>
            <p>I know but one <hi>Objection</hi> that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is liable to, which is this; That the univerſal conſent of mankind in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a God is no more an Argument that <hi>He</hi> really is, than the general agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo many Nations for ſo many Ages in the worſhip of many Gods is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that there are many.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, <hi>i.</hi> That the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and wiſe men of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59944:52"/>all Nations and Ages, did diſſent from the multitude in theſe things. They believed but one Supreme Deity, which with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the various benefits men received from him had ſeveral titles beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. And although they did ſervilely comply with the people in worſhipping God, by ſenſible images and repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet it appears by their writings that they deſpiſed this way of worſhip as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and unſuitable to the nature of God. So that <hi>Polytheiſm</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> are far from being able to pretend to univerſal conſent from their having had the vote of the multitude in moſt Nations for ſeveral Ages together. Becauſe the opinion of the vulgar ſeparated from the conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the wiſe, ſignifies no more than a great many Cyphers would do without figures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The groſs ignorance and miſtakes of the <hi>Heathen</hi> about God and his worſhip are a good argument that there is a God; becauſe they ſhew that men ſunk into the moſt degenerate condition, into the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt blindneſs and darkneſs imaginable, do yet retain ſome ſenſe and awe of a Deity; that Religion is a property of our natures and that the notion of a Deity is intimate to our underſtandings and ſticks cloſe to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59944:52"/>them, ſeeing men will rather have any God than none; and rather than want a Deity they will worſhip any thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there have been ſo many falſe Gods devis'd, is rather an argument that there is a true one than that there is none. There would be no counterfeits but for the ſake of ſomething that is real. For though all pretenders ſeem to be what they really are not, yet they pretend to be ſomething that really is. For to counterfeit is to put on the likeneſs and appearance of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al excellency. There would be no Braſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money if there were not good and lawful money. <hi>Briſtol-Stones</hi> would not pretend to be Diamonds, if there never had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diamonds. Thoſe <hi>Idols</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh's time (as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> calls them) <hi>Lambert Simnell</hi> and <hi>Perkin War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> had never been ſet up if there had not once been a real <hi>Plantagenet</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York.</hi> So the <hi>Idols</hi> of the Heathen though they be ſet up in affront to the true God, yet they rather prove that there is <hi>one</hi> than the contrary.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Speculative Atheiſme</hi> is abſurd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it requires more evidence for things than they are capable of. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath long ſince well obſerved, how unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is to expect the ſame kind of proof
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59944:53"/>and evidence for every thing, which we have for ſome things. <hi>Mathematical</hi> things, being of an abſtracted nature are capable of the cleareſt and ſtricteſt <hi>Demonſtration:</hi> But Concluſions in <hi>Natural Philoſophy</hi> are capable of proof by an <hi>Induction</hi> of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; things of a <hi>moral</hi> nature by <hi>moral</hi> arguments; and <hi>matters of fact</hi> by <hi>credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimony.</hi> And though none of theſe be capable of that ſtrict kind of <hi>demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which Mathematical matters are; yet have we an undoubted aſſurance of them, when they are proved by the beſt arguments that things of that kind will bear. No man can demonſtrate to me (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we will call every argument that is fit to convince a wiſe man a demonſtration) that there is ſuch an <hi>Iſland</hi> in <hi>America</hi> as <hi>Jamaica.</hi> Yet upon the teſtimony of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible perſons who have ſeen it, and Authors who have written of it, I am as free from all doubt concerning it, as I am from doubting of the cleareſt Mathematical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. So that this is to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as a firm <hi>Principle</hi> by all thoſe who pretend to be certain of any thing at all: <hi>That when any thing in any of theſe kinds, is proved by as good Arguments as a thing of that kind is capable of, and we have as great aſſurance that it is as we could poſſibly have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59944:53"/>ſuppoſing it were, we ought not in reaſon to make any doubt of the exiſtence of that thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to apply this to the preſent caſe. The being of a God is not <hi>Mathematically</hi> demonſtrable, nor can it be expected it ſhould, becauſe only Mathematical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters admit of this kind of evidence. Nor can it be proved <hi>immediately</hi> by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>God</hi> being ſuppoſed to be a pure ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot be the object of any corporeal ſenſe. But yet we have as great aſſurance that there is a God as the nature of the thing to be proved is capable of; and as we could in reaſon expect to have ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that he were. For let us ſuppoſe there were ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> as an <hi>Infinite Spirit,</hi> clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with all poſſible perfection, <hi>that is,</hi> as <hi>good</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>powerfull,</hi> &amp;c. as can be imagined: what conceivable ways are there whereby we ſhould come to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that there is ſuch a <hi>Being?</hi> but either by an internal impreſſion of the notion of a God upon our minds; or elſe by ſuch external and viſible effects as our Reaſon tells us muſt be attributed to ſome cauſe, and which we cannot without great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to our underſtandings attribute to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other cauſe but ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>God</hi> to be, <hi>that is,</hi> one that is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>powerfull?</hi> Now we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59944:54"/>have this double aſſurance that there is a God; and greater, or other than this the thing is not capable of: If God ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a body and preſent himſelf before our eyes, this might amaze us but could not give us any rational aſſurance that there is an <hi>Infinite Spirit.</hi> If he ſhould work a Miracle; this could not in reaſon convince an Atheiſt more than the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he already hath for it. If the Atheiſt then were to <hi>ask a ſign in the heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, or in the earth beneath,</hi> what could he deſire God to do for his conviction more than he hath already done? Could he deſire him to work a greater Miracle than to make a world? Why, if God ſhould carry this <hi>perverſe man</hi> out of the limits of this world, and ſhew him a <hi>new heaven</hi> and a <hi>new earth,</hi> ſpringing out of nothing, he might ſay that innumerable parts of matter chanc'd juſt then to rally together and to form themſelves into this new world, and that God did not make it. Thus you ſee that we have all the rational aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a God that the thing is capable of, and that <hi>atheiſm</hi> is abſurd and unreaſonable in requiring more.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> is unreaſonable, becauſe he pretends to know that which no man can know, and to be certain of that which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59944:54"/>no body can be certain of; that is, <hi>that there is no God,</hi> and which is conſequent upon this (as I ſhall ſhew afterwards) <hi>that it is not poſſible there ſhould be one.</hi> And the Atheiſt muſt pretend to know this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly. For it were the greateſt folly in the world for a man to deny and deſpiſe God, if he be not certain that <hi>He</hi> is not. Now whoever pretends to be certain that there is no God hath this great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he pretends to be certain of a pure <hi>Negative.</hi> But of <hi>negatives</hi> we have far the leaſt certainty, and they are uſually hardeſt, and many times impoſſible to be proved. Indeed ſuch <hi>negatives</hi> as onely deny ſome particular mode or manner of a things exiſtence, a man may have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of <hi>them;</hi> becauſe when we ſee things to be, we may ſee what they are, and in what manner they do or do not exiſt. <hi>For inſtance,</hi> we may be certain that man is not a creature that hath wings, becauſe this only concerns the manner of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; and we ſeeing what he Is, may certainly know that he is not ſo, or ſo. But <hi>pure negatives,</hi> that is, ſuch as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny the exiſtence of things, or the poſſibility of their exiſtence, can never be proved. For after all that can be ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a thing this will ſtill be true, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59944:55"/>many things poſſibly are which we know not of, and that many more things may be than are; and if ſo, after all our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt a thing it will be uncertain whether it be or not. And this is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true, unleſs the thing denied to be do plainly imply a contradiction; from which I have already ſhewn the notion of a God to be free. Now the Atheiſt pretends to be certain of a <hi>pure negative,</hi> that there is no ſuch being as God, and that it is not poſſible there ſhould be: But no man can reaſonably pretend to know thus much, but he muſt pretend to know all things that are or can be; which if any man ſhould be ſo vain as to pretend to, yet it is to be hoped that no body would be ſo weak as to believe him.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>Speculative atheiſm</hi> is unreaſonable, becauſe it contradicts it ſelf. There is this great contradiction in the denial of a God. He that denies a God, ſays that <hi>that</hi> is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible</hi> which yet he muſt grant to be <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> He ſays it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> that there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> as God, in ſaying that <hi>de facto</hi> there is no ſuch <hi>being.</hi> For <hi>eternity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſſential to the notion of a God, if there be not a God already it is impoſſible now that there ſhould be one; becauſe ſuch a being as is ſuppoſed to be eſſentially eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59944:55"/>and without beginning cannot <hi>now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be.</hi> And yet he muſt grant it poſſible that there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>being,</hi> becauſe it is poſſible there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>being</hi> as hath all poſſible perfection: and ſuch a <hi>being</hi> as this is that which we call <hi>God,</hi> and is that very thing which the Atheiſt denies and others affirm to be. For he that denies a God, muſt deny ſuch a being as all the world deſcribe God to be; and this is the general notion which all men have of God, <hi>that he is a being as perfect as is poſſible;</hi> that is, endued with all ſuch perfections as do not imply a contradiction, which none of thoſe perfections which we attribute to God do, as I have already prov'd.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Speculative atheiſm</hi> as it is <hi>unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> ſo is it a moſt <hi>imprudent</hi> and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable opinion: And that upon theſe <hi>two</hi> accounts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe it is againſt the preſent intereſt and happineſs of mankind. <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe it is infinitely hazardous and unſafe in the iſſue.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is againſt the preſent intereſt and happineſs of mankind. If <hi>Atheiſm</hi> were the general Opinion of the World, it would be infinitely prejudicial to the peace and happineſs of <hi>humane Society,</hi> and would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a wide door to all manner of confuſion and diſorder. But this I ſhall not now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59944:56"/>upon, becauſe I deſign a particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>that</hi> by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I ſhall at preſent content my ſelf to ſhew, how uncomfortable an opinion this would be to particular perſons. For nothing can be more evident than that <hi>man</hi> is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of himſelf to his own happineſs. He is liable to many evils and miſeries which he can neither prevent nor redreſs. He is full of wants which he cannot ſupply, and compaſs'd about with infirmities which he cannot remove, and obnoxious to dangers which he can never ſufficiently provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. Conſider <hi>man</hi> without the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and conduct of a <hi>ſuperior Being,</hi> and he is ſecure of nothing that he enjoys in this world, and uncertain of every thing that he hopes for. He is apt to grieve for what he cannot help, and eagerly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire what he is never likely to obtain. <hi>Man walketh in a vain ſhew, and diſquieteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in vain.</hi> He courts happineſs in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſhapes, and the faſter he purſues it the faſter it flies from him. His hopes and expectations are bigger than his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his fears and jealouſies more troubleſome than the evils themſelves which he is ſo much afraid of. He is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a great many inconveniences every moment of his life, and is continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59944:56"/>not onely of the good things of this life, but even of life it ſelf. And beſides all this, after all his endeavours to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he finds himſelf naturally to dread a <hi>ſuperior Being</hi> that can defeat all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and diſappoint all his hopes, and make him miſerable beyond all his fears. He has oftentimes ſecret miſgivings concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning another life after this, and fearful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of an inviſible Judge; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he is full of anxiety concerning his condition in another world, and ſometimes plung'd into that anguiſh and deſpair that he grows weary of himſelf. So that the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> deprives himſelf of all the comfort that the apprehenſions of a God can give a man, and yet is liable to all the trouble and diſquiet of thoſe apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay that theſe Inconveniences do happen to all; but every one is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them. For man's nature is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo contriv'd as does plainly diſcover how unable he is to make himſelf happy. So that he muſt neceſſarily look abroad and ſeek for happineſs ſomewhere elſe. And if there be no <hi>ſuperiour Being,</hi> in whoſe care of him he may repoſe his conſidence and quiet his mind; If he have no comfortable expectations of another life to ſuſtain him under the evils and calamities he is liable
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59944:57"/>to in this world, he is certainly <hi>of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the moſt miſerable.</hi> There are none of us but may happen to fall into thoſe circumſtances of danger, or want, or pain, or ſome other ſort of calamity, that we can have no hopes of relief or comfort but from <hi>God</hi> alone: none in all the world to flee to, but <hi>Him.</hi> And what would men do in ſuch a caſe if it were not for <hi>God?</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature is moſt certainly liable to deſperate exigencies, and he is not happy that is not provided againſt the worſt that may happen. It is bad to be reduc'd to ſuch a condition as to be deſtitute of all comfort. And yet men are many times brought to that extremity that if it were not for God they would not know what to do with themſelves, or how to enjoy themſelves for one hour, or to entertain their thoughts with any comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations under their preſent anguiſh and ſufferings. All men naturally flye to God in extremity, and the moſt atheiſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world when he is forſaken of all hopes of any other relief is forc'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him and would be glad to have ſuch a friend.</p>
            <p>Can it then be a wiſe and reaſonable deſign to endeavour to baniſh the belief of a God out of the world? Not to ſay how
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59944:57"/>impious it is in reſpect of God, nothing can be more malicious to men, and more effectually undermine the onely foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our happineſs. For if there were no God in the world man would be in a much more wretched and diſconſolate condition, than the creatures below him. For they are onely ſenſible of preſent pain, and when it is upon them they bear it as they can. But they are not at all apprehenſive of evils at a diſtance, nor tormented with the fearfull proſpect of what may befall them hereafter: nor are they plung'd into deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair upon the conſideration that the evils they lye under are like to continue, and are incapable of a remedy. And as they have no apprehenſion of theſe things, ſo they need no comfort againſt them. But Mankind is liable to all the ſame evils, and many others; which are ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe they are aggravated and ſet on by the reſtleſs workings of our minds, and exaſperated by the ſmart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions and frettings of our own thoughts: And if there be no God we are wholly without comfort under all theſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other remedy than what time will give. For if the providence of God be taken away, what ſecurity have we againſt thoſe innumerable dangers and miſchiefs
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59944:58"/>to which humane nature is continually expos'd? What conſolation under them, when we are reduc'd to that condition that no creature can give us any hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? But if we believe that there is a God that takes care of us, and we be carefull to pleaſe him, this cannot but be a mighty comfort to us, both under the preſent ſenſe of affliction, and the apprehenſion of evils at a diſtance. For in that caſe, we are ſecure of one of theſe three things. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that God by his providence will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the evils we fear, if that be beſt for us: Or that he will ſupport us under them when they are preſent, and add to our ſtrength as he encreaſeth our burthen: Or that he will make them the occaſion of a greater good to us, by turning them either to our advantage in this world, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our happineſs in the next. Now every one of theſe conſiderations has a great deal of comfort in it, for which if there were no God there could be no ground. Nay, on the contrary the moſt real foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our unhappineſs would be laid in our Reaſon; and we ſhould be ſo much more miſerable than the beaſts, by how much we have a quicker apprehenſion and a deeper conſideration of things.</p>
            <p>So that if a man had arguments ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59944:58"/>to perſwade him that there is no God (as there is infinite reaſon to the contrary) yet the belief of a God is ſo neceſſary to the comfort and happineſs of our lives, that a wiſe man could not but be heartily trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to quit ſo pleaſant an error, and to part with a deluſion which is apt to yield ſuch unſpeakable ſatisfaction to the mind of man. Did but men conſider the true notion of God, he would appear to be ſo lovely a Being, and ſo full of goodneſs and of all deſirable perfections, that even thoſe very perſons who are of ſuch irregular un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings as not to believe that there is a God, yet could not (if they underſtood themſelves) refrain from wiſhing with all their hearts that there were one. For is it not really deſirable to every man, that there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> in the world as takes care of the frame of it, that it do not run into confuſion, and in that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ruin mankind? That there ſhould be ſuch a Being, as takes particular care of every one of us, and loves us; and delights to do us good; as underſtands all our wants, and is able and willing to relieve us in our greateſt ſtraits, when nothing elſe can; to preſerve u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in our greateſt dangers, to aſſiſt us againſt our worſt enemies, and to comfort us under our ſharpeſt ſufferings,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59944:59"/>when all other things ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us? Is it not every man's intereſt, that there ſhould be ſuch a Governour of the world as really deſigns our happineſs, and hath omitted nothing that is neceſſary to it; as would govern us for our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and will require nothing of us but what is for our good, and yet will infinitely reward us for the doing of that which is beſt for our ſelves? that will puniſh any man that ſhould go about to injure us, or to deal otherwiſe with us than himſelf in the like caſe would be dealt withal by us? In a word, ſuch a one as is ready to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd to us when we have offended him, and is ſo far from taking little advantages againſt us for every failing that he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pardon our moſt wilfull miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon our Repentance and amendment? And we have reaſon to believe God to be ſuch a Being, if he be at all.</p>
            <p>Why then ſhould any man be troubl'd that there is ſuch a Being as this, or think himſelf concern'd to ſhut him out of the world? How could ſuch a Governour as this be wanting in the world, that is ſo great a comfort and ſecurity to mankind and <hi>the confidence of all the ends of the earth?</hi> If God be ſuch a being as I have deſcrib'd, woe to the world if it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59944:59"/>out him. This would be a thouſand times greater loſs to mankind and of more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal conſequence, and if it were true, ought to affect us with more grief and horrour than the extinguiſhing of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Let but all things be well conſider'd, and I am very confident that if a wiſe and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate man were left to himſelf and his own choice, to wiſh the greateſt good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he could deviſe; after he had ſearch'd heaven and earth, the <hi>ſum</hi> of all his wiſhes would be this, <hi>that there were juſt ſuch a being as God is;</hi> Nor would he chuſe any other benefactor, or friend, or protector for himſelf, or governour for the whole world, than infinite power conducted and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by infinite wiſedom and goodneſs and juſtice, which is the true <hi>notion</hi> of a God.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſo neceſſary is God to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mankind, that though there were no God, yet the Atheiſt himſelf upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts would judge it convenient that the generality of men ſhould believe that there is one. For when the Atheiſt had attain'd his end, and (if it were a thing poſſible) had blotted the notion of a God out of the minds of men, mankind would in all probability grow ſo melancholly and ſo unruly a thing, that <hi>he himſelf</hi> would think it fit in policy to contribute
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59944:60"/>his beſt endeavours to the reſtoring of men to their former belief. Thus hath God ſecur'd the belief of <hi>himſelf</hi> in the world, againſt all attempts to the contrary; not onely by rivetting the notion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into our natures, but likewiſe by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the belief of his being neceſſary to the peace and tranquillity of our minds, and to the quiet and happineſs of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>So that if we conſult our reaſon, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but believe that there is; if our intereſt, we cannot but heartily wiſh that there were ſuch a Being as God in the world. Every thing within us and without us gives notice of him. His name is written upon our hearts; and in every creature there are ſome prints and footſteps of him. Every moment we feel our dependance upon Him, and do by daily experience and that we can neither be happy without Him, nor think our ſelves ſo.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, it is not a wicked man's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, if he reſolve to continue ſuch, that there ſhould be a God; but then it is not mens intereſt to be wicked. It is for the general good of humane Society, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of particular perſons, to be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>juſt;</hi> it is for mens health to be <hi>temperate;</hi> and ſo I could inſtance in all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59944:60"/>other vertues. But this is the myſtery of Atheiſme, men are wedded to their luſts and reſolv'd upon a wicked courſe; and ſo it becomes their intereſt to wiſh there were no God, and to believe ſo if they can. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if men were minded to live righteouſly and ſoberly and vertuouſly in the world, <hi>to believe a God</hi> would be no hindrance or prejudice to any ſuch deſign; but very much for the advancement and furtherance of it. Men that are good and vertuous do eaſily believe a God; ſo that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently to be ſuſpected, that nothing but the ſtrength of mens luſts, and the power of vicious inclinations do ſway their minds and ſet a <hi>byaſs</hi> upon their underſtandings toward Atheiſm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Atheiſm is <hi>imprudent,</hi> becauſe <hi>it is unſafe in the iſſue.</hi> The Atheiſt contends againſt the religious man that there is no God; but upon ſtrange inequality and odds, for <hi>he</hi> ventures his eternal intereſt; whereas the Religious man ventures onely the loſs of his Luſts, (which it is much better for him to be without) or at the utmoſt of ſome temporal convenience; and all this while is inwardly more conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and happy, and uſually more healthfull, and perhaps meets with more reſpect and faithfuller friends, and lives in a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59944:61"/>and flouriſhing condition, and more free from the evils and puniſhments of this world, than the Atheiſtical perſon does; however, it is not much that he ventures: And after this life, if there be no God, is as well as he; but if there be a God, is Infinitely better, even as much as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and eternal happineſs is better than extream and endleſs miſery. So that if the arguments for and againſt a God were equal, and it were an even queſtion whether there were one or not; yet the hazard and danger is ſo infinitely unequal, that in point of prudence and intereſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man were obliged to incline to the affirmative: and whatever doubts he might have about it, to chooſe the ſafeſt ſide of the queſtion, and to make that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to live by. For, he that acts wiſely and is a throughly prudent man, will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt all events, and will take care to ſecure the main chance whatever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens; but the Atheiſt, in caſe things ſhould fall out contrary to his belief and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he hath made no proviſion for this caſe. If contrary to his confidence it ſhould prove in the iſſue that there is a God, the man is loſt and undone for ever. If the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt when he dies ſhould find that his ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59944:61"/>after his body and has onely quitted its lodging, how will this man be amazed and blank'd when contrary to his expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he ſhall find himſelf in a new and ſtrange place, amidſt a world of ſpirits, entred upon an everlaſting and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtate? How ſadly will the man be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed when he finds all things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he had ſtated and determined them in this World? When he comes to appear before that God whom he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and againſt whom he hath ſpoken as deſpightful things as he could, who can imagine the pale and guilty looks of this man and how he will ſhiver and tremble <hi>for the fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty?</hi> How will he be ſurpriſed with terrors on every ſide, to find himſelf thus unexpectedly and irrecoverably plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a ſtate of ruin and deſperation? And thus things may happen for all this man's confidence now. For our belief or diſ-belief of a thing does not alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing. We cannot fanſie things into being or make them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh into nothing by the ſtubborn conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our imaginations. Things are as ſullen as we are, and will be what they are whatever we think of them. And if
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59944:62"/>there be a God a man cannot by an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate disbelief of him make him ceaſe to be, any more than a man can put out the Sun by winking.</p>
            <p>And thus I have as briefly and clearly as I could endeavoured to ſhew the <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>folly</hi> of <hi>ſpeculative Atheiſme</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the <hi>exiſtence of God.</hi> And now it will be leſs needful to ſpeak of the other <hi>two Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>immortality of the ſoul,</hi> and <hi>future rewards.</hi> For no man can have any reaſonable ſcruple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>theſe,</hi> who believes that there is a God. Becauſe no man that owns the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of an <hi>infinite ſpirit</hi> can doubt of the poſſibility of a <hi>finite ſpirit,</hi> that is, ſuch a thing as is <hi>immaterial</hi> and does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any principle of <hi>corruption</hi> in it ſelf. And there is no man that believes the goodneſs of God, but muſt be inclin'd to think that he hath made ſome things for as long a duration as they are capable of. Nor can any man, that acknowledgeth the <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> providence of God, and that he loves righteouſneſs and hates iniquity, and that he is a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of the World, and conſequently concerned to countenance the obedience, and to puniſh the violation of his Laws; and that does withall conſider the promiſcuous diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59944:62"/>many times of God's Providence in this world? I ſay, no man that acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges all this, can think it unreaſonable to conclude, that after this life good men ſhall be rewarded, and ſinners puniſhed. I have done with the <hi>firſt</hi> ſort of irreligious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the <hi>ſpeculative Atheiſt.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak but briefly of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>practical Atheiſt,</hi> who is wicked and irreligious, notwithſtanding he does in ſome ſort believe that there is a God, and a future ſtate; he is likewiſe guilty of prodigious folly. The <hi>principle</hi> of the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Atheiſt</hi> argues more <hi>ignorance,</hi> but the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> argues greater <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Not to believe a God, and another life, for which there is ſo much evidence of reaſon is great ignorance and folly; but 'tis the higheſt madneſs when a man does believe theſe things to live as if he did not believe them: When a Man does not doubt but that there is a God, and that according as he demeans himſelf towards him he will make him happy or miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ever, yet to live ſo as if he were certain of the contrary, and as no man in reaſon can live but he that is well aſſured that there is no God. It was a ſhrewd ſaying of the old <hi>Monk</hi> that two kind of Priſons would ſerve for all offenders in the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59944:63"/>world, an <hi>Inquiſition</hi> and a <hi>Bedlam:</hi> If any man ſhould deny the being of a God and the immortality of the ſoul, ſuch a one ſhould be put into the firſt of theſe the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,</hi> as being a deſperate <hi>Heretick;</hi> but if any man ſhould profeſs to believe theſe things, and yet allow himſelf in any known wickedneſs, ſuch a one ſhould be put into <hi>Bedlam;</hi> becauſe there cannot be a greater folly and madneſs than for a man in matters of greateſt moment and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to act againſt his beſt reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and by his life to contradict his belief. Such a man does periſh with his eyes open, and knowingly undoes himſelf; he runs upon the greateſt dangers which he clearly ſees to be before him, and precipitates himſelf into thoſe evils which he profeſſes to believe to be real and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; and wilfully neglects the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that unſpeakable good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he is perſwaded is certain and attainable. Thus much for the <hi>ſecond</hi> way of Confirmation.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>third</hi> way of confirmation ſhall be, by endeavouring to vindicate Religion from thoſe common <hi>imputations</hi> which ſeem to charge it with <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> And they are chiefly theſe three:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Credulity.</hi>
               </item>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59944:63"/>
               <item>2. <hi>Singularity.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>Making a Fooliſh Bargain.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Credulity:</hi> Say they, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion is the belief of thoſe things for which we have no ſufficient reaſon, and conſequently of which we can have no good aſſurance; as the belief of <hi>a God,</hi> and of <hi>a future ſtate</hi> after this life; things which we never ſaw, nor did experience, nor ever ſpoke with any body that did. Now it ſeems to argue too great a forwardneſs and eaſineſs of belief to aſſent to any thing upon inſufficient grounds.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That if there be ſuch a Being as a God, and ſuch a thing as a future ſtate after this life, it cannot (as I ſaid before) in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be expected that we ſhould have the evidence of ſenſe for ſuch things: For he that believes a God, believes ſuch a Being as hath all perfections, among which this is one, that he is a ſpirit; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he is inviſible, and cannot be ſeen. He likewiſe that believes another life after this, profeſſeth to believe a ſtate of which in this life we have no trial and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Beſides, if this were a good objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that no man ever ſaw theſe things, it ſtrikes at the Atheiſt as well as us. For no man ever ſaw the World to be from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59944:64"/>nor <hi>Epicurus</hi> his <hi>Atoms,</hi> of which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he believes the World was made.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have the beſt evidence for theſe things which they are capable of at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſuppoſing they were,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe who deny theſe <hi>principles,</hi> muſt be much more credulous, that is, believe things upon incomparably leſs evidence of reaſon. The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> looks upon all that are religious as a company of credulous fools. But <hi>he,</hi> for his part, pretends to be wiſer than to believe any thing for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; he cannot entertain things upon thoſe ſlight grounds which move other men; if you would win his aſſent to any thing, you muſt give him a clear demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration for it. Now there's no way to deal with this <hi>man of reaſon,</hi> this rigid exactor of ſtrict demonſtration for things which are not capable of it, but by ſhewing him that he is an hundred times more credulous, that he begs more principles, takes more things for granted without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to prove them, and aſſents to more ſtrange concluſions upon weaker grounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than thoſe whom he ſo much accuſeth of credulity.</p>
            <p>And to evidence this, I ſhall briefly give you an account of the Atheiſt's <hi>Creed,</hi> and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59944:64"/>preſent you with a Catalogue of the <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Articles</hi> of his Faith. <hi>He believes</hi> that there is no God, nor poſſibly can be, and conſequently that the wiſe as well as unwiſe of all ages have been miſtaken, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept himſelf and a few more. <hi>He</hi> believes that either all the world have been fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an apparition of their own fancy, or that they have moſt unnaturally conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together to cozen themſelves; or that this notion of a God is a trick of policy, though the greateſt Princes and Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do not at this day know ſo much, nor have done time out of a mind. <hi>He</hi> believes, either that the Heavens and the Earth and all things in them had no Original cauſe of their being, or elſe that they were made by chance and happened he knows not how to be as they are; and that in this laſt ſhuffling of matter all things have by great good fortune fallen out as happily and as regularly as if the greateſt wiſedom had contriv'd them, but yet he is reſolv'd to believe that there was no wiſedom in the contrivance of them. He believes, that <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of it ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is utterly void of all <hi>ſenſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> and <hi>liberty;</hi> but for all that he is of opinion that the parts of matter may know and then happen to be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently diſpos'd, as to have all theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59944:65"/>and moſt dextrouſly to performe all thoſe <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>free operations</hi> which the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant attribute to Spirits.</p>
            <p>This is the ſum of his belief. And it is a wonder, that there ſhould be found any perſon pretending to reaſon or wit that can aſſent to ſuch a heap of abſurdities, which are ſo groſs and palpable that they may be felt. So that if every man had his due it will certainly fall to the Atheiſt's ſhare to be the moſt credulous perſon, that is, to believe things upon the ſlighteſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For he does not pretend to prove any thing of all this, only he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he knows not why, inclin'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo and to laugh at thoſe that do not.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>ſecond imputation</hi> is <hi>ſingularity;</hi> the affectation whereof is unbecoming a wiſe man. To this charge I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">I. If by <hi>Religion</hi> be meant the <hi>belief</hi> of the <hi>principles</hi> of Religion, that there is <hi>a God,</hi> and <hi>a providence,</hi> that <hi>our ſouls are immortal,</hi> and that there <hi>are rewa ds</hi> to be expected after this life; theſe are ſo far from being <hi>ſingular</hi> opinions, that they are and always have been the <hi>general</hi> opinion of mankind, even of the moſt <hi>barbarous</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Inſomuch, that the Hiſtories of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times do hardly furniſh us with the names of above five or ſix perſons who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59944:65"/>a God. And <hi>Lucretius</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Epicurus</hi> was the firſt who did oppoſe thoſe great <hi>foundations</hi> of Religion, the <hi>providence</hi> of God, and the <hi>immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the ſoul. <hi>Primum Grajus homo,</hi> &amp;c. meaning <hi>Epicurus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If by Religion be meant a living up to thoſe principles, that is, to act confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably to our beſt reaſon and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and to live as it does become thoſe who do believe a God and a future ſtate; this is acknowledged, even by thoſe who live otherwiſe, to be the part of every wiſe man; and the contrary to be the very <hi>madneſs of folly,</hi> and height of diſtraction: Nothing being more ordinary than for men who live wickedly to acknowledge that they ought to do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though according to the common courſe and practice of the world it be ſomewhat <hi>ſingular</hi> for men truly and throughly to live up to the principles of their <hi>Religion,</hi> yet <hi>ſingularity</hi> in this matter is ſo far from being a reflexion upon any man's prudence that it is a <hi>ſingular</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it. In two caſes <hi>ſingularity</hi> is very commendable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When there is a neceſſity of it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a man's greateſt intereſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I think it to be a reaſonable account
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59944:66"/>for any man to give why he does not live as the greateſt part of the World do, that he has no mind to die as they do and to periſh with them; he is not diſpoſed to be a fool and to be miſerable for company, he has no inclination to have his laſt end like theirs <hi>who know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of his Son, and ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is very commendable to be <hi>ſingular</hi> in any <hi>excellency,</hi> and I have ſhewn that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is the greateſt <hi>excellency:</hi> to be <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> in any thing that is wiſe, and worthy, and excellent, is not a diſparagement, but a praiſe: every man would chuſe to be thus <hi>ſingular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>third imputation</hi> is, that <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is <hi>a fooliſh bargain;</hi> becauſe they who are religious hazard the parting with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and certain happineſs for that which is future and uncertain. To this I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let it be granted, that the aſſurance which we have of future rewards falls ſhort of the evidence of ſenſe. For I doubt not, but that ſaying of our <hi>Saviour, bleſſed is he who hath believed, and not ſeen;</hi> and thoſe expreſſions of the <hi>Apoſtle, we walk by faith and not by ſight,</hi> and <hi>faith is the evidence of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59944:66"/>things not ſeen,</hi> are intended by way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement and diminution to the evidence of Faith, and do ſign fie that the report and teſtimony of others is not ſo great evidence as that of our own ſenſes: And though we have ſufficient aſſurance of another ſtate, yet not man can think we have ſo great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as if we our ſelves had been in the other world and ſeen how all things are there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have ſufficient aſſurance of theſe things, and ſuch as may beget in us a well grounded confidence and frees us from all doubts of the contrary and perſwade a reaſonable man to venture his greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts in this world upon the ſecurity that he hath of another: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have as much aſſurance of theſe things as things future and at a diſtance are capable of, and he is a very unreaſonable man that would deſire more: Future and inviſible things are not capable of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of ſenſe; but we have the greateſt rational evidence for them, and in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very reaſonable man ought to reſt ſatisfi'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have as much as is abundantly ſufficient to juſtifie every man's diſcretion, who for the great and eternal things of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world hazards or parts with the poor and tranſitory things of this life. And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59944:67"/>for the clearing of this it will be worth our conſidering, that the greateſt affairs of this world, and the moſt important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of this life are all conducted onely by <hi>moral</hi> demonſtrations. Men eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day venture their lives and eſtates onely upon <hi>moral</hi> aſſurance. For inſtance, men who never were at the <hi>eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> or in <hi>Turky</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> yet do venture their whole eſtate in traffick thither, though they have no <hi>Mathematical demonſtration</hi> but onely <hi>moral aſſurance</hi> that there are ſuch places. Nay which is more, men every day eat and drink, though I think no man can demonſtrate out of <hi>Euclide</hi> or <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that his <hi>Baker</hi> or <hi>Brewer,</hi> or <hi>Cook</hi> have not conveyed poiſon into his meat or drink. And that man that would be ſo wiſe and cautious as not to eat or drink till he could demonſtrate this to himſelf, I know no other remedy for him but that in great gravity and wifedom he muſt die for fear of death. And for any man to urge that though men in temporal affairs proceed upon moral aſſurance, yet there is greater aſſurance required to make men ſeek Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and avoid Hell, ſeems to me to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unreaſonable. For ſuch an aſſurance of things as will make men circumſpect and carefull to avoid a leſſer dangér ought in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59944:67"/>all reaſon to awaken men much more to the avoiding of a greater, ſuch an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as will ſharpen mens deſires and quicken their endeavours for the obtaining of a leſſer good ought in all reaſon to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate men more powerfully and to inſpire them with a greater vigour and induſtry in the purſuit of that which is infinitely greater. For why the ſame aſſurance ſhould not operate as well in a great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as in a leſs, in a great good as in a ſmall and inconſiderable one, I can ſee no reaſon; unleſs men will ſay, that the greatneſs of an evil danger is an incouragement to men to run upon it, and that the greatneſs of any good and happineſs ought in reaſon to diſhearten men from the purſuit of it.</p>
            <p>And now I think I may with reaſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat ſuch as are atheiſtically inclined to conſider theſe things ſeriouſly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; and if there be weight in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which I have offered to them to ſway with reaſonable men, I would beg of ſuch that they would not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be byaſſed by prejudice or paſſion, or the intereſt of any luſt or worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to a contrary perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would entreat them ſeriouſly and diligently to conſider theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of ſo great moment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59944:68"/>to every man. If any thing in the world deſerve our ſerious ſtudy and conſideration, theſe principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do. For what can import us more to be ſatisfied in than whether there be a God, or not? whether our Souls ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with our bodies, or be immortal and ſhall continue for ever? And if ſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that eternal ſtate which remains for men after this life, they ſhall not be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or miſerable for ever according as they have demeaned themſelves in this world? If theſe things be ſo, they are of infinite conſequence to us; and therefore it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns us to enquire diligently about them, and to ſatisfie our minds concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them one way or other. For theſe are not matters to be ſlightly and ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thought upon, much leſs (as the way of atheiſtical men is) to be played and jeſted withall. There is no greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a light and inconſiderate perſon, than prophanely to ſcoff at Religion. It is a ſign that that man hath no regard to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that he is not touched with a ſenſe of his own intereſt, who loves to be jeſting with edg'd tools and to play with life and death. This is the very mad-man that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Prov. 26.18.</note> 
               <hi>who caſteth fire-brands, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and death, and ſaith, am I not in ſport?</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59944:68"/>To examine ſeverely and debate ſeriouſly the principles of Religion, is a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a wiſe man; but if any man ſhall turn Religion into raillery, and think to confute it by two or three bold jeſts, this man doth not render Religion, but himſelf ridiculous, in the opinion of all conſiderate men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſports with his own life. If the principles of Religion were doubtfull and uncertain, yet they concern us ſo nearly that we ought to be ſerious in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them. And though they were never ſo clear and evident, yet they may be made ridiculous by vain and frothy men; as the graveſt and wiſeſt perſon in the world may be abuſed by being put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>fools coat,</hi> and the moſt noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Poem may be debaſed and made vile by being turned into <hi>burleſque.</hi> But of this I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more largely in my next diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>So that it concerns every man, that would not trifle away his ſoul and fool himſelf into irrecoverable miſery, with the greateſt ſeriouſneſs to enquire into theſe matters whether they be ſo or not, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to conſider the arguments which are brought for them. For many have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried about theſe things, not becauſe there is not reaſon and evidence enough for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59944:69"/>them, but becauſe they have not had pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience enough to conſider them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider theſe things imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. All wicked men are of a party againſt Religion. Some luſt or intereſt ingageth them againſt it. Hence it comes to paſs that they are apt to ſlight the ſtrongeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that can be brought for it, and to cry up very weak ones againſt it. Men do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and without difficulty aſſent to <hi>Mathematical</hi> truths, becauſe it is no bodies intereſt to deny them; but men are ſlow to believe <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> Truths, becauſe by their luſts and intereſt they are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt them. And therefore you may obſerve that the more vertuouſly any man lives, and the leſs he is enſlaved to any luſt, the more ready he is to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the principles of Religion.</p>
            <p>Therefore when you are examining theſe matters, do not take into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any ſenſual or worldly intereſt, but deal clearly and impartially with your ſelves. Let not temporal and little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ſway you againſt a greater and more durable intereſt. Think thus with your ſelves, that you have not the making of things true or falſe, but that the truth and exiſtence of things is already fix'd and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that the principles of Religion
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59944:69"/>are already either determinately true or falſe before you think of them, either there is a God, or there is not; either your Souls are Immortal, or they are not; one of theſe is certain and neceſſary, and is not now to be altered; the truth of things will not comply with our conceits, and bend it ſelf to our intereſts. Therefore do not think what you would have to be, but conſider impartially what is, and (if it be) will be whether you will or no. Do not reaſon thus; I would fain be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and therefore it is my intereſt that there ſhould be no God, nor no life after this; and therefore I will endeavour to prove that there is no ſuch thing, and will ſhew all the favour I can to that <hi>ſide</hi> of the <hi>queſtion;</hi> I will bend my underſtanding and wit to ſtrengthen the negative, and will ſtudy to make it as true as I can. This is fond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the way to cheat thy ſelf; and that we may do as often as we pleaſe, but the nature of things will not be impoſed upon. If then thou be as wiſe as thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be, thou wilt reaſon thus with thy ſelf; my higheſt intereſt is not to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about theſe matters, therefore ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all other conſiderations I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to know the truth and yield to that.</p>
            <p>And now it is time to draw towards a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59944:70"/>concluſion of this long diſcourſe. And that which I have all this while been endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to convince men of and to perſwade them to, is no other but what God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth particularly recommend to us as proper for <hi>humane</hi> conſideration, <hi>unto Man he ſaid, behold the fear of the Lord that is wiſedom, and to depart from evil is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> Whoever pretends to reaſon, and calls himſelf a <hi>man,</hi> is oblig'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God and to demean himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly towards him. For God is to the underſtanding of man as the light of the Sun is to our eyes, the firſt and the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the moſt glorious object of it. He fills Heaven and earth, and every thing in them does repreſent him to us. Which way ſoever we turn our ſelves, we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with clear evidences and ſenſible demonſtrations of a Deity. For (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> reaſons) <hi>The inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> 
               <hi>being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſo that they are without excuſe;</hi> that is, thoſe men that know not God have no apology to make for themſelves. Or if men do know and believe that there is ſuch a being as God, not to conſider the proper conſequences of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59944:70"/>ſuch a Principle, not to demean our ſelves towards him as becomes our relation to him and dependance upon him and the duty which we naturally owe him, this is great ſtupidity and inconſiderateneſs.</p>
            <p>And yet he that conſiders the lives and actions of the greateſt part of men would verily think that they underſtood nothing of all this. Therefore the <hi>Scripture</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents wicked men as without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. <hi>It is a Nation void of counſel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32.28. Pſal. 14.4</note> 
               <hi>neither is there any underſtanding in them:</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>have all the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity no knowledge;</hi> Not that they are deſtitute of the natural faculty of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but they do not uſe it as they ought; they are not blind but they wink, <hi>they detain the truth of God in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and though they know God, yet they do not glorifie him as God,</hi> nor ſuffer the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of him to have a due influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon their hearts and lives.</p>
            <p>Men generally ſtand very much upon the credit and reputation of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and of all things in the world hate to be accounted fools, becauſe it is ſo great a reproach. The beſt way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this imputation and to bring off the credit of our underſtandings is to be truly religious, <hi>to fear the Lord, and to depart
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59944:71"/>from evil.</hi> For certainly there is no ſuch imprudent perſon as he that neglects God and his ſoul, and is careleſs and ſlothful about his everlaſting concernments; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this man acts contrary to his trueſt reaſon and beſt intereſt; he neglects his own ſafety, and is active to procure his own ruine; he flies from happineſs and runs away from it as faſt as he can, but purſues miſery, and makes haſte to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Hence it is that <hi>Solomon</hi> does all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> give the title of <hi>fool</hi> to a wicked man, as if it were his proper name and the fitteſt character of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſo eminently ſuch: There is no fool to the ſinner, who every moment ventures his Soul, and lays his everlaſting intereſt at the ſtake. Every time a man provokes God he does the greateſt miſchief to himſelf that can be imagined. A mad man that cuts himſelf and tears his own fleſh and daſhes his head againſt the ſtones does not act ſo unreaſonably as he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not ſo ſenſible of what he does. Wickedneſs is a kind of <hi>voluntary</hi> frenzy and a <hi>choſen</hi> diſtraction, and every ſinner does wilder and more extravagant things than any man can do that is craz'd and out of his wits, onely with this ſad difference that he knows better what he does. For
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59944:71"/>to them who believe another life after this, an eternal ſtate of happineſs or miſery in another world, (which is but a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>poſtulatum</hi> or demand among <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) there is nothing in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> more demonſtrable than the folly of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men; for it is not a clearer and more evident principle <hi>that the whole is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than a part,</hi> than that eternity and the concernments of it are to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time.</p>
            <p>I will therefore put the matter into a temporal Caſe, that wicked men who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any thing of the rules and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of worldly wiſedom may ſee the imprudence of an irreligious and ſinfull courſe, and be convinced <hi>that this their way is their folly, even themſelves being judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is that man wiſe, as to his body and his health, who onely cloaths his hands but leaves his whole body naked? who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides onely againſt the tooth-ach, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects whole troops of mortal diſeaſes that are ready to ruſh in upon him? Juſt thus does he who takes care only for this vile body, but neglects his precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul; who is very ſolicitous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſmall and temporal inconveniences, but takes no care to <hi>eſcape the damnation of hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:59944:72"/>
            <p>Is he a prudent man, as to his temporal eſtate, that lays deſigns only for a day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proſpect to, or proviſion for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of his life? even ſo does he that provides for the ſhort time of this life, but takes no care for all Eternity, which is to be wiſe for a moment, but a fool for ever, and to act as untowardly and as croſly to the reaſon of things as can be imagined, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard time as if it were eternity, and to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect eternity as if it were but a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>Do we count him a wiſe man, who is wiſe in any thing but in his own proper profeſſion and employment, wiſe for every body but himſelf; who is ingenious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive his own miſery and to do himſelf a miſchief, but is dull and ſtupid as to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning of any real benefit and advantage to himſelf? Such a one is he, who is ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Calling but a bad Chriſtian; for Chriſtianity is more our proper calling and profeſſion than the very trades we live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſuch is every ſinner, who is <hi>wiſe to do evil, but to do good hath no underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it wiſedom in any man to neglect and diſoblige him who is his beſt friend, and can be his ſoreſt enemy? or with one weak troop to go out to meet him that comes againſt him with thouſands of thouſands, to flie a ſmall danger and run upon a greater? Thus
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59944:72"/>does every wicked man that neglects and contemns God, <hi>who can ſave or deſtroy him;</hi> who ſtrives with his <hi>Maker and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh the Lord to jealouſie,</hi> and with the ſmall and inconſiderable forces of a man takes the field againſt the <hi>mighty God, the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> who <hi>fears them that can kill the body, but after that have no more that they can do; but fears not him, who after he hath kill'd, can deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell;</hi> and thus does he who for fear of any thing in this world ventures to diſpleaſe God, for in ſo doing he runs away from men, and <hi>falls into the hands of the living God,</hi> he flies from a temporal danger and leaps into Hell.</p>
            <p>Is not he an imprudent man, who in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greateſt moment and concernment neglects opportunities never to be retriev'd, who ſtanding upon the ſhore, and ſeeing the tide making haſte towards him apace, and that he hath but a few minutes to ſave himſelf, yet will lay himſelf to ſleep there till the cruel ſea ruſh in upon him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm him? And is he any better who trifles away this day of God's grace and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and fooliſhly adjourns the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work of repentance and the weighty buſineſs of Religion to a dying hour.</p>
            <p>And to put an end to theſe queſtions,

               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:59944:74"/>Is he wiſe who hopes to attain the End without the means, nay, by means that are quite contrary to it? ſuch is every wicked man who hopes to be bleſſed hereafter without being holy here, and to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that is, to find a pleaſure in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God and in the company of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirits by rendring himſelf as unſuitable and unlike to them as he can.</p>
            <p>Wouldſt thou then be truly wiſe? Be wiſe for thy ſelf, wiſe for thy ſoul, wiſe for eternity. Reſolve upon a religious courſe of life. <hi>Fear God and depart from evil.</hi> Look beyond things preſent and ſenſible unto things which are not ſeen and are eternal, labour to ſecure the great intereſts of another world, and refer all the actions of this ſhort and dying life to that ſtate which will ſhortly begin but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have an end: and this will approve it ſelf to be wiſedom at the laſt, whatever the world judge of it now. For not that which is approved of men now, but what ſhall finally be approved by God is true wiſedom; that which is eſteemed ſo by him who is the fountain and original of all wiſedom, the firſt rule and meaſure, the beſt and moſt competent judge of it.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59944:74"/>
            <p>I deny not but that thoſe that are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and neglect Religion may think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſe, and may enjoy this their delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a while: But there is a time a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the moſt prophane and atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, who now account it a peice of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and an argument of a great ſpirit and of a more than common wit and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to ſlight God and to baffle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and to level all the diſcourſes of another world with the Poetical deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Fairy-land; I ſay, there is a day a coming when all theſe witty fools ſhall be unhappily undeceived, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to enjoy their deluſion any longer ſhall call themſelves fools for ever.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I uſe ſo much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to perſwade men to that which is ſo excellent, ſo uſefull, and ſo neceſſary? The thing it ſelf hath allurements in it beyond all arguments: For if Religion be the beſt knowledge and wiſdom I cannot offer any thing beyond this to your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to raiſe your eſteem of it, I can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent nothing beyond this to your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to excite your love and deſire. All that can be done is to ſet the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, and to offer it to their choice; and if mens natural deſire of wiſdom and knowledge and happineſs will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59944:75"/>them to be religious, 'tis in vain to uſe arguments if the ſight of theſe beauties will not charm mens affections, 'tis to no purpoſe to go about to compell a liking, and to urge and puſh forward a match to the making whereof conſent is neceſſary. Religion is matter of our freeſt choice, and if men will obſtinately and wilfully ſet themſelves againſt it there is no remedy. <hi>Pertinacioe nullum remedium poſuit Deus, God has provided no remedy for the obſtinacy of men;</hi> but if they will chuſe to be fools and to be miſerable, he will leave them to inherit their own choice and to enjoy the portion of ſinners.</p>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> we will conſider the nature of the ſin here mentioned, which is <hi>ſcoffing</hi> at Religion, <hi>There ſhall come ſcoffers:</hi> Theſe it ſeems were a ſort of people that deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59944:76"/>our Saviour's prediction of his coming to judge the world. So the Apoſtle tells us in the next words, that they ſaid <hi>where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In thoſe times there was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſwaſion among Chriſtians <hi>that the day of the Lord was at hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.2.</note> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> elſewhere tells us. Now this 'tis probable, theſe <hi>ſcoffers</hi> twitted the Chriſtians withall; and becauſe Chriſt did not come when ſome looked for him they concluded he would not come at all. Upon this they derided the Chriſtians as enduring perſecution in a vain expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which was never likely to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. They ſaw all things continue <hi>as they were from the beginning of the world,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the apprehenſions of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans concerning the approaching end of it; <hi>For ſince the Fathers fell aſleep all things continue as they were, from the beginning of the world.

               </gap>, which may either be rendred <hi>from the time,</hi> or elſe (which ſeems more agreeable to the atheiſtical diſcourſe of theſe men) <hi>ſaving</hi> or <hi>except that the fathers are fallen aſleep, all things continue as they were;</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that men die and one generation ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds another, they ſaw no change or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteration.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59944:77"/>going on in a conſtant courſe; One ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men paſſed away and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came in the room of it, but the world remain'd ſtill as it was. And thus for ought they knew things might hold on for ever. So that the principles of theſe men ſeem to be much the ſame with thoſe of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who denied the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God and the immortality of mens ſouls; and conſequently a future judgment which ſhould ſentence men to rewards and puniſhments in another world. Theſe great and fundamental principles of all Religion they derided as the fancies and dreams of a company of melancholy men, who were weary of the world and pleaſed themſelves with vain conceits of happineſs and eaſe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life. But as for them, they believed none of thoſe things; and therefore gave all manner of licence and indulgence to their luſts.</p>
            <p>But this belongs to the ſecond thing I propounded to ſpeak to, namely,</p>
            <p n="2">II. The character which is here given of theſe <hi>ſcoffers;</hi> They are ſaid <hi>to walk after their own luſts.</hi> And no wonder if when they denied a future judgment they gave up themſelves to all manner of ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:59944:77"/>
            <p>St. <hi>Jude</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> gives much the ſame character of them that St. <hi>Peter</hi> here does, ver. 18, 19. <hi>There ſhall come in the laſt days mockers, walking after their own ungodly luſts, ſenſual, not having the ſpirit.</hi> So that we ſee what kind of perſons they are who prophanely ſcoff at Religion, men of ſenſual ſpirits and of licentious lives. For this character which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here gives of the <hi>ſcoffers</hi> of that age was not an accidental thing which happened to thoſe perſons, but is the conſtant character of them who deride Religion, and flows from the very temper and diſpoſition of thoſe who are guilty of this impiety; it is both the uſual preparation to it, and the natural conſequent of it.</p>
            <p>To deride God and Religion is the higheſt kind of impiety. And men do not uſually arrive to this degree of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at firſt, but they come to it by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſteps. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> very elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth to us the ſeveral gradations by which men at laſt come to this horrid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of impiety; <hi>Bleſſed is the man, that walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </note> 
               <hi>nor ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornfull.</hi> Men are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally firſt corrupted by bad counſel and company, which is called <hi>walking in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59944:78"/>counſel of the ungodly!</hi> next they habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves to their vicious practices, which is <hi>ſtanding in the way of ſinners;</hi> and then at laſt they take up and ſettle in a contempt of all Religion, which is called <hi>ſitting in the ſeat of the ſcornfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For when men once indulge themſelves in wicked courſes, the vicious inclinations of their minds ſway their underſtandings, and make them apt to disbelieve thoſe truths which contradict their luſts. Every inordinate luſt and paſſion is a falſe byaſs upon mens underſtandings which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally draws toward Atheiſm. And when mens judgments are once byaſſed they do not believe according to the evidence of things, but according to their humour and their intereſt. For when men live as if there were no God it becomes expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for them that there ſhould be none: And then they endeavour to perſwade themſelves ſo, and will be glad to find ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to fortifie themſelves in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. Men of diſſolute lives cry down Religion, becauſe they would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſtraints of it; they are loth to be tied up by the ſtrict laws and rules of it: 'Tis their intereſt more than any reaſon they have againſt it which makes them deſpiſe it, they hate it becauſe they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59944:78"/>are reproved by it. So our Saviour tells us, that <hi>men love darkneſs rather than light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 3.19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe their deeds are evil; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light leſt his deeds ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember it is the ſaying of <hi>one,</hi> who hath done more by his <hi>Writings</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch the Age with Atheiſtical principles than any man that lives in it, <hi>That when reaſon is againſt a man, then a man will be againſt reaſon.</hi> I am ſure this is the true account of ſuch mens enmity to Religion, Religion is againſt them and therefore they ſet themſelves againſt Religion. The principles of Religion and the doctrines of the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> are terrible ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to wicked men, they are contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flying in their faces and galling their conſciences: And this is that which makes them kick againſt Religion and ſpurn at the doctrines of that <hi>holy Book.</hi> And this may probably be one reaſon why many men, who are obſerved to be ſufficiently dull in other matters, yet can talk prophanely and ſpeak againſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with ſome kind of ſalt and ſmartneſs, becauſe Religion is the thing that frets them; and as in other things ſo in this <hi>vexatio dat intellectum,</hi> the inward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59944:79"/>and vexation of their minds gives them ſome kind of wit and ſharpneſs in rallying upon Religion. Their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are galled by it, and this makes them winch and fling as if they had ſome metal. For, let men pretend what they will, there is no eaſe and comfort of mind to be had from atheiſtical principles. 'Tis found by experience, that none are more apprehenſive of danger or more fearfull of death than this ſort of men: Even when they are in proſperity they ever and anon feel many inward ſtings and laſhes, but when any great affliction or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity overtakes them they are the moſt poor ſpirited creatures in the whole world.</p>
            <p>The ſum is, the true reaſon why any man is an Atheiſt is becauſe he is a wicked man. Religion would curb him in his luſts, and therefore he caſts it off and puts all the ſcorn upon it he can. Beſides, that men think it ſome kind of apology for their vices that they do not act contrary to any principle they profeſs: Their practice is agreeable to what they pretend to believe, and ſo they think to vindicate themſelves and their own practices by laughing at thoſe for fools who believe any thing to the contrary</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:59944:79"/>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>third</hi> thing I propounded was, to repreſent to you the heinouſneſs and the aggravations of this vice. And to make this out we will make theſe three ſuppoſitions, which are as many as the thing will bear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Suppoſe there were no God, and that the principles of Religion were falſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe the matter were doubtfull, and the arguments equal on both ſides.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſe it certain that there is a God, and that the principles of Religion are true. Put the caſe how we will, I ſhall ſhew that the humour is intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Suppoſe there were no God, and that the principles of Religion were falſe. Not that there is any reaſon for ſuch a ſuppoſition, but onely to ſhew the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of this humour; Put the caſe that theſe men were in the right, in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principles of Religion, and that all that they pretend were true; yet ſo long as the generality of mankind believes the contrary, it is certainly a great rudeneſs, or incivility at leaſt, to deride and ſcoff at theſe things. Indeed upon this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there could be no ſuch thing as ſin, but yet it would be a great offence againſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59944:80"/>the laws of civil converſation. Suppoſe then, the Atheiſt were wiſer than all the world, and that he did upon good grounds know that all mankind, beſides himſelf and two or three more, were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken about the matters of Religion; yet if he were either ſo wiſe, or ſo civil as he ſhould be, he would keep all this to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not affront other men about theſe things.</p>
            <p>I remember that that <hi>Law</hi> which God gave to the people of <hi>Iſrael, Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Rulers of thy people;</hi> is rendred by <hi>Joſephus</hi> in a very different ſenſe: <hi>What other nations account Gods, let no man blaſpheme.</hi> And this is not ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as at firſt ſight one would imagine, for the ſame <hi>Hebrew</hi> word ſignifies both <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Rulers.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be the meaning of that <hi>Law</hi> or not there is a great deal of reaſon in the thing. For though every man have a right in diſpute againſt a falſe Religion, and to urge it with all its abſurd and ridiculous conſequences, as the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> did in their diſputes with the <hi>Heathen;</hi> yet it is a barbarous incivility for any man ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilouſly to make ſport with that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers account Religion, not with any deſign to convince their reaſon but onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke their rage.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:59944:80"/>
            <p>But now the Atheiſt can pretend no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of conſcience why he ſhould ſo much as diſpute againſt the principles of Religion, much leſs deride them. He that pretends to any Religion may pretend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for oppoſing a contrary Religion: But he that denies all Religion, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no conſcience for any thing. A man may be obliged indeed in reaſon and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humanity to free his neighbour from a hurtfull error; but ſuppoſing there were no God this notion of a Deity and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion have taken ſuch deep root in the mind of man that either they are not to be extinguiſhed, or if they be it would be no kindneſs to any man to endeavour it for him, becauſe it is not to be done but with ſo much trouble and violence that the remedy would be worſe than the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>For if this notion of a Deity be founded in a natural fear, it is in vain to attempt to expell it; for whatever violence may be offer'd to nature by endeavouring to reaſon men into a contrary perſwaſion, nature will ſtill recoil and at laſt return to it ſelf, and then the fear will be augmented from the apprehenſion of the dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſuch an impiety. So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can create more trouble to a man than to endeavour to diſpoſſeſs him of this
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59944:81"/>conceit, becauſe nature is but irritated by the conteſt and the man's fears will be doubled upon him.</p>
            <p>But if we ſuppoſe this apprehenſion of a Deity to have no foundation in nature, but to have had its riſe from tradition which hath been confirmed in the world by the prejudice of education, the difficulty of removing it will almoſt be as great as if it were natural, that which men take in by education being next to that which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. And if it could be extinguiſh't, yet the advantage of it will not recompence the trouble of the cure. For, except the avoiding of perſecution for Religion, there is no advantage that the principles of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm if they could be quietly ſetled in a man's mind can give him. The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage indeed that men make of them is to give themſelves the liberty to do what they pleaſe, to be more ſenſual and more unjuſt than other men; that is, they have the priviledge to ſurfeit themſelves and to be ſick oftner than other men, and to malte mankind their enemy by their unjuſt and diſhoneſt actions, and conſequently to live more uneaſily in the world than other men.</p>
            <p>So that the principles of Religion, the <hi>belief of a God,</hi> and <hi>another life,</hi> by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging men to be vertuous do really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59944:81"/>their temporal happineſs. And all the priviledge that Atheiſm pretends to is to let men looſe to vice, which is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended with temporal inconveniences. And if this be true, then the Atheiſt cannot pretend this Reaſon of charity to mankind (which is the onely one I can think of) to diſpute againſt Religion, much leſs to ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it. For it is plain, that it would be no kindneſs to any man to be undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in theſe principles of Religion, ſuppoſing they were falſe. Becauſe the principles of Religion are ſo far from hindering that they promote a man's happineſs even in this world, and as to the other world there can be no inconvenience in the miſtake, for when a man is not it will be no trouble to him that he was once deceived about theſe matters.</p>
            <p>And where no obligation of conſcience nor of reaſon can be pretended, there cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally the laws of civility ought to take place. Now men do profeſs to believe that there is a God, and that the common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion are true, and to have a great veneration for theſe things. Can there then be a greater inſolence, than for a man when he comes into company to rally and fall ſoul upon thoſe things for which he knows the company have a reverence?
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59944:82"/>Can one man offer a greater affront to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than to expoſe to ſcorn him whom he owns and declares to be his beſt friend, the patron of his life, and the greateſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor he hath in the world? And doth not every man that owns a God ſay this of him?</p>
            <p>But when the generality of Mankind are of the ſame opinion the rudeneſs is ſtill the greater. So that whoever doth openly contemn God and Religion does <hi>delinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in majeſtatem populi &amp; humani generis',</hi> he does offend againſt the majeſty of the People and that reverence which is due to the common apprehenſions of Mankind, whether they be true or not; which is the greateſt incivility that can be imagin'd.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt conſideration, and it is the leaſt that I have to urge in this matter. But yet I have inſiſted the longer upon it, becauſe it is ſuch a one as ought eſpecially to prevail upon thoſe whom I am afraid are too often guilty of this vice, I mean thoſe who are of better breeding, becauſe they pretend to underſtand the laws of behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and the decencies of converſation bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than other men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſing it were doubtful whether there be a God or not, and whether the Principles of Religion were true or not, and that the Arguments were equal on
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59944:82"/>both Sides; yet it would be a great folly to deride theſe things. And here I ſuppoſe as much as the Atheiſt can with any colour of reaſon pretend to. For no man ever yet pretended to demonſtrate that there is no God, nor no life after this. For theſe being pure negatives are capable of no proof, unleſs a man could ſhew them to be plainly impoſſible. The utmoſt that is pretended is that the arguments that are brought for theſe things are not ſufficient to convince. But if they were onely proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo long as no arguments are produced to the contrary that cannot in reaſon be denied to be a great advantage.</p>
            <p>But I will for the preſent ſuppoſe the probabilities equal on both ſides. And upon this ſuppoſition I doubt not to make it appear to be a monſtrous folly to deride theſe things. Becauſe though the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on both ſides were equal, yet the danger and hazard is infinitely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal.</p>
            <p>If it prove true that there is no God the religious man may be as happy in this world as the atheiſt, nay the principles of Religion and Vertue do in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tend to make him happier. Becauſe they give ſatisfaction to his mind, and his conſcience by this means is freed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59944:83"/>from many fearful girds and twinges which the Atheiſt feels. Beſides, that the practice of Religion and vertue doth naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our temporal felicity. It is more for a man's health, and more for his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and more for his advantage in all other worldly reſpects to lead a vertuous than a vitious courſe of life. And for the other world, if there be no God the caſe of the religious man and the Atheiſt will be alike, becauſe they will both be extinguiſht by death and inſenſible of any farther happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery.</p>
            <p>But then if the contrary opinion ſhould prove true, that there is a God; and that the ſouls of men are tranſmitted out of this world into the other, there to receive the juſt reward of their actions: Then it is plain to every man at firſt ſight, that the caſe of the religious man and the Atheiſt muſt be vaſtly different: Then, where ſhall the wicked, and the ungodly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? And what think we ſhall be the portion of thoſe who have affronted God, and derided his word, and made a mock of every thing that is ſacred and religious? What can they expect but to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him whom they have renounced, and to feel the terrible effects of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Juſtice which they have deſpiſed?
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59944:83"/>So that though the arguments on both ſides were equal, yet the danger is not ſo. On the one ſide there is none at all, but 'tis infinite on the other. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, it muſt be a monſtrous folly for any man to make a mock of thoſe things which he knows not whether they be or not; and if they be, of all things in the world they are no jeſting matters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſe there be a God and that the principles of Religion are true, then is it not onely a heinous impiety but a perfect madneſs to ſcoff at theſe things. And that there is a God, and that the Principles of Religion are true, I have already in my former <hi>diſcourſe</hi> endeavoured to prove; both from the things which are made, and from the general conſent of mankind in theſe principles; of which univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent no ſufficient Reaſon can be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were true. And ſuppoſing they are ſo, it is not onely the utmoſt pitch of impiety, but the higheſt flight of folly that can be imagined to deride theſe things. To be diſobedient to the commands of God is a great contempt, but to deny his <hi>Being,</hi> and to make ſport with his <hi>word,</hi> and to endeavour to render it ridiculous by turning the wiſe and weighty ſayings of that: <hi>Holy Book</hi> into raillery, is a moſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59944:84"/>direct affront to the God that is above. Thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> deſcribes theſe atheiſtical perſons as levelling their blaſphemies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately againſt the majeſty of heaven. <hi>They ſet their mouth againſt the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth;</hi> they do miſchief among men, but the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front is immediately to God.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that this prophane ſpirit is an argument of a moſt incorrigible temper. The <hi>Wiſe man</hi> every where ſpeaks of the <hi>ſcorner</hi> as one of the worſt ſort of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and hardeſt to be reclaimed, becauſe he <hi>deſpiſeth inſtruction</hi> and mocks at all the means whereby he ſhould be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>And then, is it not a moſt black and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ingratitude thus to uſe the Authour of our Beings and the Patron of our Lives; to make a ſcorn of him that made us, and to live in an open defiance of him <hi>in whom we live, move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi> But this is not all. As it is a moſt heinous ſo it is a moſt dangerous impiety, to deſpiſe him that can deſtroy us, and to oppoſe him who is infinitely more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than we are. <hi>Will ye</hi> (ſays the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>provoke the Lord to jealouſie? are ye ſtronger than he?</hi> What <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in another caſe, may with a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59944:84"/>little change be applied to this ſort of men; If there be a God, and the principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be true <hi>ye cannot overthrow them, therefore refrain from ſpeaking againſt theſe</hi> things <hi>leſt ye be found fighters againſt God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will but add one thing more to ſhew the folly of this prophane temper. And that is this, that as it is the greateſt of all other ſins ſo there is in truth the leaſt temptation to it. When the Devil tempts men with riches or honour to ruin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves he offers them ſome kind of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, but the prophane perſon ſerves the Devil for nought, and ſins only for ſin's ſake, ſuffers himſelf to be tempted to the greateſt ſins and into the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for no other reward but the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reputation of ſeeming to ſay that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily which no wiſe man would ſay. And what a folly is this, for a man to offend his conſcience to pleaſe his humour, and onely for his jeſt to loſe two of the beſt Friends he hath in the world, God and his own ſoul?</p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>three</hi> things I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to ſpeak to upon this Argument, And now I beg your patience to apply what I have ſaid to theſe three purpoſes.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59944:85"/>
            <p n="1">1. To take men off from this impious and dangerous folly of prophaneneſs which by ſome is miſcalled wit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To caution men not to think the worſe of Religion, becauſe ſome are ſo bold as to deſpiſe and deride it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To perſwade men to employ that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and wit which God hath given them, to better and nobler purpoſes in the ſervice, and to the glory of that God who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed theſe gifts on men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To take men off from this impious and dangerous folly. I know not how it comes to paſs that ſome men have the fortune to be eſteemed Wits onely for jeſting out of the common road, and for making bold to ſcoff at thoſe things which the greateſt part of mankind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. As if a man ſhould be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Wit for reviling thoſe in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is no more an argument of any man's wit than it is of his diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A wiſe man would not ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly of a great Prince though he were out of his Dominions, becauſe he remembers that Kings have long hands, and that their power and influence does many times reach a great way farther than
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59944:85"/>their direct Authority. But God <hi>is a great King, and in his hand are all the corners of the earth; we can go no whither from his Spirit, nor can we flee from his preſence;</hi> where-ever we are <hi>his eye ſees us</hi> and <hi>his right hand</hi> can reach us. If men did truly conſult the intereſt either of their ſafety or reputation, they would never exerciſe their wit in dangerous matters. Wit is a very commendable quality, but then a wiſe man ſhould always have the keeping of it. It is a ſharp weapon, as apt for miſchief as for good purpoſes if it be not well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd. The proper uſe of it is to ſeaſon converſation, to repreſent what is praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to the greateſt advantage, and to expoſe the vices and follies of men, ſuch things as are in themſelves truly ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: But if it be applied to the abuſe of the graveſt and moſt ſerious matters it then loſes its commendation. If any man think he abounds in this quality and hath wit to ſpare there is ſcope enough for it within the bounds of Religion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and when it tranſgreſſeth theſe it degenerates into inſolence and impiety. All wit which borders upon prophaneneſs and makes bold with thoſe things to which the greateſt reverence is due deſerves to be branded for folly.</p>
            <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59944:86"/>
            <p>And if we would preſerve our ſelves from the infection of this vice we muſt take heed how we ſcoff at Religion, under any form, leſt inſenſibly we derive ſome contempt upon Religion it ſelf. And we muſt likewiſe take heed how we accuſtom our ſelves to a ſlight and irreverent uſe of the Name of God, and of the phraſes and expreſſions of the Holy Bible, which ought not to be applied upon every light occaſion. Men will eaſily ſlide into the higheſt degree of prophaneneſs who are not careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a due reverence of the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Name of God, and an awfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Holy Scriptures. None ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed to ſcoffing at Religion as thoſe who have accuſtomed themſelves to ſwear upon trifling occaſions. For it is juſt with God to permit thoſe who allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in one degree of prophaneneſs to proceed to another, till at laſt they come to that height of impiety as to contemn all Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let no man think the worſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, becauſe ſome are ſo bold as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and deride it. For 'tis no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any perſon or thing to be laught at, but to deſerve to be ſo. The moſt grave and ſerious matters in the whole world are liable to be abus'd. It is a known ſaying of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59944:86"/>
               <hi>Epictetus, that every thing hath two han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles;</hi> By which he means, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo bad but a man may lay hold of ſomething or other about it that will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford matter of excuſe and extenuation, nor nothing ſo excellent but a man may faſten upon ſomething or other belonging to it whereby to reduce it. A ſharp wit may find ſomething in the wiſeſt man whereby to expoſe him to the contempt of injudicious people. The graveſt book that ever was written may be made ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous by applying the ſayings of it to a fooliſh purpoſe. For a jeſt may be obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon any thing. And therefore no man ought to have the leſs reverence for the principles of Religion, or for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, becauſe idle and prophane Wits can break jeſts upon them. Nothing is ſo eaſie as to take particular phraſes and expreſſions out of the beſt Book in the world and to abuſe them by forcing an odd and ridiculous ſenſe upon them. But no wiſe man will think a good Book foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for this reaſon, but the man that abuſes it; nor will he eſteem that to which every thing is liable to be a juſt exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any thing. At this rate we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all things, but ſurely the better and the ſhorter way is to contemn thoſe who
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59944:87"/>would bring any thing that is worthy into contempt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, to perſwade men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy that reaſon and wit which God hath given them to better and nobler pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in the ſervice and to the glory of that God who hath beſtowed theſe gifts on men, as <hi>Aholiab</hi> and <hi>Bezaleel</hi> did their mechanical skill in the adorning and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of God's Tabernacle. For this is the perfection of every thing, to attain its true and propor end; and the end of all thoſe gifts and endowments which God hath given us is to glorifie the giver.</p>
            <p>Here is ſubject enough to exerciſe the wit of men and angels: To praiſe that infinite goodneſs, and almighty power, and exquiſite wiſedom which made us and all things; and to admire what we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſufficiently praiſe; To vindicate the wiſe and juſt providence of God, in the government of the world; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as well as we can upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect view of things, to make out the beauty and harmony of all the ſeeming diſcords and irregularities of the Divine adminiſtrations; To explain the oracles of the holy Scriptures, and to adore that great myſtery of Divine love (which the Angels, better and nobler Creatures than
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59944:87"/>we are, deſire to pry into) God's ſending his onely Son into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to give his life a ranſom for them: Theſe would be noble exerciſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the tongues and pens of the greateſt Wits. And ſubjects of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are the beſt trials of our ability in this kind. Satyr and invective are the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt kind of wit. Almoſt any degree of it will ſerve to abuſe and find fault. For wit is a keen inſtrument, and every one can cut and gaſh with it, but to carve a beautiful image and to poliſh it requires great art and dexterity. To praiſe any thing well is an argument of much more wit, than to abuſe. A little wit, and a great deal of ill nature will furniſh a man for Satyr, but the greateſt inſtance of wit is to commend well. And perhaps the beſt things are the hardeſt to be duly commended. For though there be a great deal of matter to work upon yet there is great judgment required to make choice, and where the ſubject is great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent it is hard not to ſink below the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it.</p>
            <p>This I ſay on purpoſe to recommend to men a nobler exerciſe for their wits, and if it be poſſible, to put them out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit with that ſcoffing humour which is ſo
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59944:88"/>eaſie, and ſo ill natur'd, and is not onely an enemy to Religion but to every thing elſe that is wiſe and worthy. And I am very much miſtaken, if the State as well as the Church, the civil government as well as Religion, do not in a ſhort ſpace find the intolerable inconvenience of this humour.</p>
            <p>But I confine my ſelf to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion. And it is ſad indeed, that in a Nation profeſſing Chriſtianity ſo horrid an impiety ſhould dare to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. But the Scripture hath foretold us that this ſort of men ſhould ariſe in the Goſpel-age, and they did appear even in the Apoſtles days. That which is more ſad and ſtrange is, that we ſhould perſiſt in this prophaneneſs notwithſtanding the terrible judgments of God which have been abroad in this Nation. God hath of late years manifeſted himſelf in a very dreadful manner, as if it were on purpoſe to give a check to this inſolent impiety. And now that thoſe judgments have done no good upon us we may juſtly fear that he will appear once for all. And 'tis time for him to ſhew himſelf when his very Being is call'd in queſtion, and to come and judge the world when men begin to doubt whether he made it.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:59944:88"/>
            <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> mentions two things as the fore-runners and reaſons of his coming to judgment, <hi>infidelity,</hi> and <hi>prophane ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing</hi> at Religion.<note place="margin">Luke 18.8.</note>

            <p>ONE of the firſt principles that is planted in the nature of man, and which lies at the very root and foundation of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the deſire of his own preſervation and happineſs. Hence it is that every man is led by intereſt, and does love or hate, chuſe or refuſe things, according as he apprehends them to conduce to this end, or to contradict it. And becauſe the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this life is moſt preſent and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, therefore humane nature (which in this degenerate ſtate is extremely ſunk down into ſenſe) is moſt powerfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59944:90"/>with ſenſible and temporal things. And conſequently, there cannot be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er prejudice raiſed againſt any thing than to have it repreſented as inconvenient and hurtfull to our temporal intereſts.</p>
            <p>Upon this account it is that Religion hath extremely ſuffer'd in the opinion of many as if it were oppoſite to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent welfare, and did rob men of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantages and conveniences of life. So that he that would do right to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and make a ready way for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of it among men, cannot take a more effectual courſe than by recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling it with the happineſs of mankind and by giving ſatisfaction to our reaſon, that it is ſo far from being an enemy that it is the greateſt friend to our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral intereſts; and that it doth not onely tend to make every man happy conſider'd ſingly and in a private capacity, but is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently fitted for the benefit of humane ſociety.</p>
            <p>How much Religion tends even to the temporal advantage of private perſons I ſhall not now conſider, becauſe my Text leads me to diſcourſe of the other, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſhew how advantageous Religion and Vertue are to the publick proſperity of a Nation, which I take to be the meaning
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59944:90"/>of this <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> of <hi>Solomon, Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall not reſtrain <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to the particular vertue of juſtice, (though in this ſenſe alſo this ſaying is moſt true) but enlarge it according to the <hi>genius</hi> and ſtrain of the Book of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi> in which the words <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> are commonly uſed very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively ſo as to ſignifie all Religion and Vertue. And that this word is ſo to be taken in the Text may appear farther from the oppoſition of it to ſin or vice in general; <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> exalteth a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but <hi>Sin</hi> is the reproach of any People.</p>
            <p>You ſee then what will be the ſubject of my preſent diſcourſe; namely, that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Vertue are the great cauſes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick happineſs and proſperity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the truth of this hath been univerſally acknowledged and long enough experienced in the world, yet becauſe the faſhion of the age is to call every thing into queſtion it will be requiſite to ſatisfie mens reaſon about it. To which end I ſhall do theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Endeavour to give an account of this Truth.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59944:91"/>
            <p n="2">2. To vindicate it from the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and inſinuations of atheiſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p n="1">I. ſhall give you this two-fold account of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the juſtice of the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the natural tendency of the thing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the juſtice of the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Indeed, as to particular perſons, the providences of God are many times promiſcuouſly adminiſtred in this world; ſo that no man can certainly conclude God's love or hatred to any perſon by any thing that befalls him in this life. But God do's not deal thus with Nations. Becauſe publick bodies and communities of men, as ſuch, can onely be rewarded and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in this world. For in the next, all thoſe publick ſocieties and combinations wherein men are now link'd together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeveral Governments, ſhall be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. God will not then reward or puniſh Nations, as Nations; But every man ſhall then give an account of himſelf to God, and receive his own reward, and bear his own burthen. For although God account it no diſparagement to his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59944:91"/>to let particular good men ſuffer in this world and paſs <hi>through many tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into the kingdom of God,</hi> becauſe there is another day a coming which will be a more proper ſeaſon of reward; yet in the uſual courſe of his providence he recompenſeth religious and vertuous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with temporal bleſſings and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For which reaſon St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us that the mighty ſucceſs and long proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Romans</hi> was a reward given them by God for their eminent juſtice and temperance, and other vertues. And on the other hand, God many times ſuffers the moſt grievous ſins of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to go unpuniſhed in this world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows that his juſtice will have another and better opportunity to meet and reckon with them. But the general and crying ſins of a Nation cannot hope to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape publick judgments, unleſs they be prevented by a general repentance. God may defer his judgments for a time and give a People a longer ſpace of repentance, he may ſtay till the iniquities of a Nation be full, but ſooner or later they have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect his vengeance. And uſually the longer puniſhment is delay'd it is the heavier when it comes.</p>
            <p>Now all this is very reaſonable, becauſes
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59944:92"/>this world is the onely ſeaſon for Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhments. And indeed they are in a great degree neceſſary for the preſent vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the honour and majeſty of the Divine Laws, and to give ſome check to the overflowing of wickedneſs. Publick judgments are the banks and ſhores upon which God breaks the inſolency of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and ſtays their proud waves. And though among men the multitude of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders be many times a cauſe of impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe of the weakneſs of humane Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments which are glad to ſpare where they are not ſtrong enough to puniſh, yet in the government of God, things are quite otherwiſe. No combination of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is too hard for him, and the greater and more numerous the offenders are, the more his juſtice is concern'd to vindicate the affront. However God may paſs by ſingle ſinners in this world, yet when a Nation combines againſt him, <hi>when hand joyns in hand the wicked ſhall not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the <hi>Scripture</hi> declares to be the ſettled courſe of God's providence; That a righteous Nation ſhall be happy; <hi>The work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace; and the effects of righteouſneſs, quietneſs and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance for ever.</hi> And on the other hand,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59944:92"/>that he uſeth to ſhower down his judgments upon a wicked people, <hi>he turneth a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full land into barrenneſs for the wickedneſs of them that dwell therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the experience of all ages hath made this good. All along the Hiſtory of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> we find the interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able providences of God towards the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> always ſuited to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. They were conſtantly proſperous or afflicted according as piety and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue flouriſhed or declined amongſt them. And God did not onely exerciſe this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards his own People, but he dealt thus alſo with other Nations. The <hi>Roman Empire</hi> whilſt the vertue of that people remained firm was <hi>ſtrong as iron,</hi> as 'tis repreſented in the Propheſie of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel:</hi> But upon the diſſolution of their manners the <hi>iron</hi> began <hi>to be mixt with miry clay,</hi> and the <hi>feet</hi> upon which that Empire ſtood, <hi>to be broken.</hi> And though God in the adminiſtration of his juſtice be not tied to precedents, and we cannot argue from Scripture examples that the providences of God towards other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall in all circumſtances be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his dealings with the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet thus much may with great probability be collected from them, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59944:93"/>as God always bleſſed that People while they were obedient to him, and followed them with his judgments when they rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt him, ſo he will alſo deal with other Nations. Becauſe the reaſon of thoſe diſpenſations as to the main and ſubſtance of them ſeems to be perpetual; and founded in that which can never change, the juſtice of the Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The truth of this farther appears, from the natural tendency of the thing. For Religion in general, and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular vertue, doth in its own nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the publick Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Religion, where-ever it is truly plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is certainly the greateſt obligation upon conſcience to all civil offices and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties. Chaſtity and temperance and induſtry do in their own nature tend to health and plenty. Truth and fidelity in all our dealings do create mutual love and good-will and confidence among men, which are the great bands of peace. And on the contrary, wickedneſs doth in its own nature produce many publick miſchiefs. For as ſins are link'd together and draw on one another, ſo almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vice hath ſome temporal inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence annexed to it and naturally follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59944:93"/>it. Intemperance and luſt breed infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and diſeaſes, which being propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpoil the ſtrain of a Nation. Idleneſs and luxury bring forth poverty and want; and this tempts men to injuſtice, and that cauſeth enmity and animoſities, and theſe bring on <hi>ſtrife</hi> and <hi>confuſion and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evil work.</hi> This Philoſophical account of publick troubles and confuſions St. <hi>James</hi> gives us,<note place="margin">Jam. 4.1.</note> 
               <hi>whence come wars and fightings among you? are they not hence, even from your luſts that war in your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall ſhew more particularly, that Religion and vertue do naturally tend to the good order and more eaſie govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of humane Society, becauſe they have a good influence both upon Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates and Subjects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Upon Magiſtrates. Religion teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to rule over men in the fear of God, becauſe though they be Gods on earth yet they are ſubjects of Heaven, and accountable to Him who is higher than the higheſt in this world. Religion in a Magiſtrate ſtrengthens his authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it procures veneration and gains a reputation to it. And in all the affairs of this world ſo much reputation is really ſo much power. We ſee that piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59944:94"/>where they are found among men of lower degree, will command ſome reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect: But in perſons of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place and dignity they are ſeated to a great advantage, ſo as to caſt a luſtre upon their very Place and by a ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion to double the beams of Majeſty. Whereas impiety and vice do ſtrangely leſſen greatneſs, and do ſecretly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably derive ſome weakneſs upon authority it ſelf. Of this the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives us a remarkable inſtance in <hi>David.</hi> For among other things which made <hi>the Sons of Zurviah too hard for him</hi> this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably was none of the leaſt, that they were particularly conſcious to his crimes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Religion hath a good influence upon the People; to make them obedient to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and peaceable one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To make them obedient to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conformable to Laws; and that <hi>not onely for wrath</hi> and out of fear of the Magiſtrates power, which is but a weak and loofe principle of obedience, and will ceaſe when ever men can rebel with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to advantage; but out <hi>of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which is a firm, and conſtant and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle, and will hold a man faſt when all other obligations will break. He
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59944:94"/>that hath entertain'd the true principles of Chriſtianity is not to be tempted from his obedience and ſubjection by any worldly conſiderations, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that <hi>whatſoever reſiſteth authority reſiſteth the ordinance of God,</hi> and that <hi>they who reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Religion tends to make men peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one towards another. For it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to plant all thoſe qualities and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in men which tend to peace and unity, and to fill men with a ſpirit of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal love and good will. It endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours likewiſe to ſecure every man's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt by commanding the obſervation of that great rule of equity, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them;</hi> by enjoyning that truth and fidelity be inviolably obſerved in all our words, promiſes and contracts. And in order hereunto it requires the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of all thoſe paſſions and vices which render men unſociable and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to one another, as pride, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and injuſtice, hatred and revenge and cruelty; and thoſe likewiſe which are not ſo commonly reputed vices, as ſelf-conceit and peremptorineſs in a man's own opinion, and all peeviſhneſs, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59944:95"/>incompliance of humour in things lawful and indifferent.</p>
            <p>And that theſe are the proper effects of true piety the doctrine of our Saviour and his Apoſtles every where teacheth us. Now if this be the deſign of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to bring us to this temper, thus to heal the natures of men and to ſweeten their ſpirits, to correct their paſſions and to mortifie all thoſe luſts which are the cauſes of enmity and diviſion, then it is evident that in its own nature it tends to the peace and happineſs of humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; and that if men would but live as Religion requires they ſhould do the world would be a quiet habitation, a moſt love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deſirable place in compariſon of what now it is. And indeed the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the ſocieties of men are ſo full of tumult and diſorder, ſo troubleſome and tempeſtuous, is becauſe there is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of true Religion among men; ſo that were it not for ſome ſmall remainders of piety and vertue which are yet left ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd among mankind, humane ſociety would in a ſhort ſpace disband and run into confuſion, the earth would grow wild and become a great foreſt, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would become beaſts of prey one towards another. And if this diſcourſe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59944:95"/>hold true ſurely then one would think that vertue ſhould find it ſelf a ſeat where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever humane ſocieties are, and that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould be owned and encouraged in the world until men ceaſe to be governed by reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I come to vindicate this truth from the inſinuations and pretences of atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons. I ſhall mention two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Government may ſubſiſt well enough without the belief of a God and a ſtate of rewards and puniſhments after this life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That as for vertue and vice they are arbitrary things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Government may ſubſiſt well enough without the belief of a God or a ſtate of rewards and puniſhments after this life. And this the Atheiſt does and muſt aſſert, otherwiſe he is by his own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a declared enemy to Government and unfit to live in humane ſociety.</p>
            <p>For anſwer to this, I will not deny but that though the generality of men did not believe any ſuperior Being nor any rewards and puniſhments after this life, yet notwithſtanding this there might be ſome kind of Government kept up in the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59944:96"/>world. For ſuppoſing men to have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the neceſſities of humane nature and the miſchiefs of confuſion would probably compel them into ſome kind of order. But then I ſay withall, that if theſe principles were baniſhed out of the world Government would be far more difficult than now it is, becauſe it would want its firmeſt Baſis and foundation; there would be infinitely more diſorders in the world if men were reſtrained from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and violence onely by humane laws, and not by principles of conſcience and the dread of another world. Therefore Magiſtrates have always thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerned to cheriſh Religion, and to maintain in the minds of men the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a God and another life. Nay that common ſuggeſtion of atheiſtical perſons, that Religion was at firſt a politick device and is ſtill kept up in the world as a State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engine to awe men into obedience, is a clear acknowledgment of the uſefulneſs of it to the ends of Government, and does as fully contradict that pretence of theirs which I am now confuting as any thing that can be ſaid.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That vertue and vice are arbitrary things founded onely in the imaginations of men and in the conſtitutions and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59944:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>cuſtoms of the world, but not in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things themſelves; and that <hi>that</hi> is vertue or vice, good or evil, which the Supream Authority of a Nation declares to be ſo. And this is frequently and confidently aſſerted by the ingenious Author of a very bad Book, I mean the <hi>Leviathan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the proper way of anſwering any thing that is confidently aſſerted is to ſhew the contrary, namely, That there are ſome things that have a natural evil and deformity in them, as perjury, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs, unrighteouſneſs and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which are things not onely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the poſitive laws and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of particular Nations and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but by the general verdict of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature: And that the vertues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe have a natural goodneſs and comelineſs in them, and are ſuitable to the common priciples and ſentiments of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
            <p>And this will moſt evidently appear by putting this ſuppoſition. Suppoſe the reverſe of all that which we now call vertue were ſolemnly enacted, and the practice of fraud, and rapine, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and falſeneſs to a man's word, and all manner of vice and wickedneſs were
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59944:97"/>eſtabliſhed by a Law. I ask now, if the caſe between vertue and vice were thus alter'd, would that which we now call vice in proceſs of time gain the reputation of vertue, and that which we now call ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue grow odious and contemptible to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature? If it would not, then is there ſomething in the nature of good and evil, of vertue and vice, which does not depend upon the pleaſure of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor is ſubject to any arbitrary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. But that it would not be thus I am very certain, becauſe no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could ſubſiſt upon theſe terms. For the very enjoyning of fraud and rapine and perjury and breach of truſt doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently deſtroy the greateſt end of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which is to preſerve men in their rights againſt the encroachments of fraud and violence. And this end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed humane ſocieties would preſently fly in pieces and men would neceſſarily fall into a ſtate of war. Which plainly ſhews that vertue and vice are not arbitrary things, but that there is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and immutable and eternal reaſon for that which we call goodneſs and vertue, and againſt that which we call vice and wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to evidence
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59944:97"/>and vindicate this truth. I ſhall onely draw an Inference or two from this diſcourſe, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If this diſcourſe be true, then thoſe who are in place of power and authority are peculiarly concerned to maintain the honour of Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It concerns every one to live in the practice of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Magiſtrates are concerned to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the honour of Religion, which doth not onely tend to every man's future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but is the beſt inſtrument of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government and of the temporal proſperity of a Nation. For the whole deſign of it is to procure the private and publick happineſs of mankind, and to reſtrain men from all thoſe things which would make them miſerable and guilty to themſelves, unpeaceable and troubleſome to the world. Religion hath ſo great an influence upon the felicity of men that it ought to be upheld, and the veneration of it maintained, not onely out of a juſt dread of the Divine vengeance in another world, but out of regard to the temporal peace and proſperity of men. It will requite all the kindneſs and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59944:98"/>honour we can do it by the advantages it will bring to Civil Government, and by the bleſſings it will draw down upon it. God hath promiſed that <hi>thoſe that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, he will honour,</hi> and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of his providence he uſually makes this good, ſo that the civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ought to be very tender of the honour of God and Religion, if for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon yet out of <hi>reaſon of State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were to be wiſht that all men were ſo piouſly diſpoſed, that Religion by its own authority and the reaſonable force of it might be ſufficient to eſtabliſh its Empire in the minds of men. But the corruptions of men will always make a ſtrong oppoſition againſt it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the firſt planting of the Chriſtian Religion in the world God was pleaſed to accompany it with a miraculous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: But after it was planted this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power ceaſed, and God hath now left it to be maintained and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by more ordinary and humane ways, by the countenance of Authority, and the aſſiſtance of Laws; which were never more neceſſary than in this degenerate age, which is prodigiouſly ſunk into Atheiſm and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, and is running head-long into an humour of ſcoffing at God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59944:98"/>and every thing that is ſacred. For ſome ages before the Reformation Atheiſm was conſined to <hi>Italy,</hi> and had its chief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at <hi>Rome.</hi> All the mention that is of it in the Hiſtory of thoſe times that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelves give us in the lives of their own Popes and Cardinals, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two or three ſmall Philoſophers that were retainers to that Court. So that this Atheiſtical humour among Chriſtians was the ſpawn of the groſs ſuperſtitious and corrupt manners of the Romiſh Church and Court. And indeed nothing is more natural than for extreames in Religion to beget one another, like the vibrations of a <hi>pendulum</hi> which the more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you ſwing it one way the farther it will return the other. But in the laſt age, Atheiſm travel'd over the <hi>Alpes</hi> and infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>France,</hi> and now of late it hath croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Seas and invaded our Nation and hath prevailed to amazement: For I do not think that there are any people in the World that are generally more indiſpoſed to it and can worſe brook it, ſeriouſneſs and zeal in Religion bing almoſt the natural temper of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> So that nothing is to me matter of greater wonder, than that in a grave and ſober Nation prophaneneſs ſhould ever come
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59944:99"/>to gain ſo much ground, and the beſt and the wiſeſt Religion in the world to be made the ſcorn of fools. For beſides the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and atheiſtical diſcourſes about God and Religion, and the bold and ſenſleſs abuſes of this <hi>ſacred Book</hi> the great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our ſalvation, which are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the publick places of reſort; I ſay, beſides theſe (I ſpeak it knowingly) a man can hardly paſs the ſtreets without having his ears grated and pierced with ſuch horrid and blaſphemous oaths and curſes as are enough, if we were guilty of no other ſin, to ſink a Nation. And this not onely from the <hi>Tribe</hi> that wear Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, but from thoſe that go before them and ſhould give better example. Is it not then high time that the Laws ſhould provide by the moſt prudent and effectual means to curb theſe bold and inſolent defiers of Heaven, who take a pride in being monſters, and boaſt themſelves in the follies and deformities of humane nature? The Heathens would never ſuffer their Gods to be reviled, which yet were no Gods. And ſhall it among the profeſſors of the true Religion be allowed to any man to make a mock of Him that made Heaven and Earth, and to breath out blaſphemies againſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59944:99"/>Him who gives us life and breath and all things? I doubt not but hypocriſie is a great wickedneſs and very odious to God, but by no means of ſo pernicious example as open prophaneneſs. Hypocriſie is a more modeſt way of ſinning, it ſhews ſome reverence to Religion, and does ſo far own the worth and excellency of it as to acknowledge that it deſerves to be counterfeited: Whereas prophaneneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares openly againſt it, and endeavours to make a party to drive it out of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It concerns every one to live in the practice of Religion and Vertue; Becauſe the publick happineſs and proſperity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it. It is moſt apparent that of late years Religion is very ſenſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd among us. The manners of men have almoſt been univerſally corrupted by a Civil War. We ſhould therefore all joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to retrieve the ancient ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Nation, and to bring into faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on again that ſolid and ſubſtantial, that plain and unaffected piety, (free from the extreams both of ſuperſtition and enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm) which flouriſhed in the age of our immediate Forefathers. Which did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in idle talk but in real effects, in a ſincere love of God and of our neighbour,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59944:100"/>in a pious devotion and reverence towards the Divine Majeſty, and in the vertuous actions of a good life; in the denial of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> and <hi>in living ſoberly and righteouſly and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world.</hi> This were the true way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God to us, to ſtop the courſe of his judgments, and to bring down the bleſſings of Heaven upon us.</p>
            <p>God hath now been pleaſed to ſettle us again in peace both at home and abroad, and he hath put us once more into the hands of our own counſel. Life and Death, bleſſing and curſing, proſperity and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are before us. We may chuſe our own fortune, and if we be not wanting to our ſelves we may under the influences of God's grace and aſſiſtance, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanting to our ſincere endeavours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a happy and a proſperous People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The good God make us all wiſe to know and to do the things that belong to the temporal peace and proſperity of the Nation, and to the eternal happineſs and ſalvation of every one of our ſouls; which we humbly beg for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, to whom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I have already ſhown how much Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59944:101"/>tends to the publick welfare of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; to the ſupport of Government, and to the peace and happineſs of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. My work at this time ſhall be to ſhew that Religion and obedience to the Laws of God do likewiſe conduce to the happineſs of particular perſons, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this world and the other. For though there be but little expreſs menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul and the rewards of another life, yet all Religion does ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe principles, and is built upon them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew how Religion conduceth to the happineſs of this life; and that both in reſpect of the inward and outward man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the mind; to be pious and religious brings a double advantage to the mind of man. 1. It tends to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our underſtandings. 2. It brings peace and pleaſure to our minds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It tends to the improvement of our underſtandings. I do not mean onely that it inſtructs us in the knowledge of divine and ſpiritual things, and makes us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the great intereſt of our ſouls and the concernments of eternity better, but that in general it does raiſe and enlarge the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59944:101"/>minds of men and make them more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of true knowledge. And in this ſenſe I underſtand the following Texts;<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.8.</note> 
               <hi>The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord is pure, enlightning the eyes; The fear of the Lord is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of wiſdom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 111.10.</note> 
               <hi>a good underſtanding have all they that keep his commandments; Thou through thy commandments haſt made me wiſer than mine enemies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.98.</note> which plainly refers to political prudence; <hi>I have more underſtanding than all my teachers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 99.</note> 
               <hi>for thy Teſtimonies are my meditation, I underſtand more than the ancients, becauſe I keep thy precepts;</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 104. ver. 130.</note> 
               <hi>Through thy precepts I get underſtanding; The enterance of thy word giveth light, it giveth underſtanding to the ſimple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Religion doth improve the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of men by ſubduing their luſts, and moderating their paſſions. The luſts and paſſions of men do ſully and darken their minds, even by a natural influence. Intemperance and ſenſuality and fleſhly luſts do debaſe mens minds, and clog their ſpirits, make them groſs and foul, liſtleſs and unactive; they ſink us down into ſenſe, and glew us to theſe low and inferiour things like <hi>birdlime</hi> they hamper and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle our ſouls, and hinder their flight upwards; they indiſpoſe and unfit our
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59944:102"/>minds for the moſt noble and intellectual conſiderations. So likewiſe the exorbitant paſſions of wrath and malice, envy and revenge, do darken and diſtort the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of men, do tincture the mind with falſe colours and fill it with prejudice and undue apprehenſions of things.</p>
            <p>There is no man that is intemperate or luſtful, or paſſionate but beſides the guilt he contracts which is continually fretting and diſquieting his mind, beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences he brings upon himſelf as to his health, he does likewiſe ſtain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the brightneſs of his Soul and the clearneſs of his diſcerning faculty. Such perſons have not that free uſe of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they might have; their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are not bright enough, nor their ſpirits pure and fine enough for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the higheſt and nobleſt acts of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. What clearneſs is to the eye that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is to our mind and underſtanding, and as the clearneſs of the bodily eye doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it for a quicker ſight of material ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſo doth the purity of our minds, that is, freedom from luſt and paſſion, diſpoſe us for the cleareſt and moſt perfect acts of reaſon and underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Now Religion doth purifie our minds and refine our ſpirits by quenching the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59944:102"/>fire of luſt and ſuppreſſing the fumes and vapours of it, and by ſcattering the clouds and miſts of paſſion. And the more any man's ſoul is cleanſed from the filth and dregs of ſenſual luſts the more nimble and expedite it will be in its operations. The more any man conquers his paſſions, the more calm and ſedate his ſpirit is, and the greater equality he maintains in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, his apprehenſions of things will be the more clear and unprejudic'd, and his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more firm and ſteddy. And this is the meaning of that ſaying of <hi>Solomon, He that is ſlow to wrath is of great underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but he that is haſty of ſpirit exalteth folly, Ira furor brevis eſt</hi>—Anger is a ſhort fit of madneſs, and he that is paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and furious deprives himſelf of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſpoils his underſtanding, and helps to make himſelf a fool: whereas he that conquers his paſſions and keeps them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, doth thereby preſerve and improve his underſtanding. Freedom from irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar paſſions doth not onely ſignifie that a man is wiſe, but really contributes to the making of him ſuch.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Religion tends to the eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the peace and tranquillity of our minds; wherein happineſs chiefly conſiſts and which all the wiſdom and Philoſophy
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59944:103"/>of the world did always aim at, as the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt felicity of this life. And that this is the natural fruit of a religious and vertuous courſe of life, the Scripture declares to us in theſe Texts;<note place="margin">Pſal. 97.11.</note> 
               <hi>Light is ſown for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart; Great peace have all they that love thy Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.165.</note> 
               <hi>and nothing ſhall offend them; Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 3.17.</note> 
               <hi>and all her paths are peace;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 32.17.</note> 
               <hi>The fruit of righteouſneſs is peace and the effect of righteouſneſs quietneſs and aſſurance for ever;</hi> The plain ſenſe of which Texts is that pleaſure and peace do naturally reſult from a holy and good life. When a man hath once engag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Religious courſe, and is habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to piety and holineſs, all the exerciſes of Religion and devotion, all acts of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vertue are delightfull to him. To honour and worſhip God, to pray to him and to praiſe him, to ſtudy his will, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon him and to love him, all theſe bring great pleaſure and peace along with them. What greater contentment and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction can there be to the mind of man, when it is once purifi'd and refin'd from the dregs of ſenſual pleaſures and delights, and rais'd to its true height and pitch, than to contemplate and admire the infinite excellencies and perfections of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59944:103"/>God, to adore his greatneſs and to love his goodneſs? How can the thoughts of God be troubleſome to any one who lives ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly and righteouſly and godly in the world? No man that loves goodneſs and righteous;neſs hath any reaſon to be afraid of God, or to be diſquieted with the thoughts of him. There is nothing in God that is terrible to a good man, but all the apprehenſions which we naturally have of him ſpeak comfort and promiſe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuch a one. The conſideration of his attributes is ſo far from being a trouble to him that it is his recreation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. It is for wicked men to dread God, and to endeavour to baniſh the thoughts of him out of their minds; but a holy and vertuous man may have quiet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturb'd thoughts even of the juſtice of God, becauſe the terrour of it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him.</p>
            <p>Now Religion doth contribute to the peace and quiet of our minds theſe two ways. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By allaying thoſe paſſions which are apt to ruffle and diſcompoſe our ſpirits. Malice and hatred, wrath and revenge are very fretting and vexatious and apt to make our minds ſore and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie, but he that can moderate theſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will find a ſtrange eaſe and pleaſure
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59944:104"/>in his own ſpirit. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by freeing us from the anxieties of guilt, and the fears of divine wrath and diſpleaſure; than which nothing is more ſtinging and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and renders the life of man more miſerable and unquiet. And wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a ſpring of peace and joy muſt it needs be to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend upon good grounds that God is reconcil'd to us and become our friend; that all our ſins are perfectly forgiven and ſhall never more be remembred againſt us! What unexpreſſible comfort does over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the pious and devout ſoul from the remembrance of a holy and well-ſpent life and a conſcience of its own innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and integrity! And nothing but the practice of Religion and Vertue can give this eaſe and ſatisfaction to the mind of man. For there is a certain kind of temper and diſpoſition which is neceſſary to the pleaſure and quiet of our minds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to our happineſs: and that is holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs, which as it is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſo is it likewiſe the happineſs of the Divine nature: And on the contrary, the chief part of the miſery of wicked men, and of thoſe accurſed ſpirits the Devils is this, that they are of a diſpoſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God; they are envious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and cruel, and of ſuch a temper as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59944:104"/>is naturally a torment and diſquiet to it ſelf. And here the foundation of Hell is laid, in the evil diſpoſition of mens minds; and till this be cur'd, which can onely be done by Religion, it is as impoſſible for a man to be happy, that is, pleas'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented within himſelf, as it is for a ſick man to be at eaſe. Becauſe ſuch a man hath that within him which torments him, and he cannot be at eaſe till that be remov'd. The man's ſpirit is out of order and off the hinges, and till that be put into its right frame he will be perpetually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted and can find no reſt within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The <hi>Prophet</hi> very fitly deſcribes to us the unquiet condition of wicked men,<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.10.21.</note> 
               <hi>The wicked is like the troubled ſea when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt; there is no peace (ſaith my God) to the wicked.</hi> So long as ſin and corruption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in our hearts they will be reſtleſly working, like wine which will be in a perpetual motion and agitation till it have purg'd it ſelf of its dregs and foulneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Religion does likewiſe tend to the happineſs of the outward man. Now the bleſſings of this kind are ſuch as either reſpect our <hi>health,</hi> or <hi>eſtate,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> or relations; and in reſpect of all theſe Religion is highly advantageous to us.</p>

            <p n="1">1. As to our health, a Religious and vertuous life doth eminently conduce to that, and to long life as a conſequent of it. And in this ſenſe I underſtand theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Texts;<note place="margin">Prov. 3.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>My Son forget not my Law, but let thy heart keep my Commandments; for length of days, and long life, ſhall they add to thee;</hi> and v. 7, and 8. <hi>Fear the Lord and depart from evil, it ſhall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones;</hi> and v. 16. among the temporal advantages of wiſdom or Religion this is mention'd as the firſt and principal, <hi>length of days is in her right hand;</hi> and v. 18. <hi>ſhe is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her;</hi> and again, <hi>Whoſo findeth me, findeth life, but he that ſinneth againſt me wrongeth his own ſoul;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 8.35, 36.</note> (that is injurious to his own life) <hi>all they that hate me love death;</hi> all which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true in a ſpiritual ſenſe, but is certainly meant by <hi>Solomon</hi> in the natural ſenſe. And theſe promiſes, of the bleſſings of health and long life to good men are not only declaratory of the good pleaſure and intention of God towards them, but likewiſe of the natural tendency of the thing. For Religion doth oblige men to the practice of thoſe vertues which do in their own nature conduce to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our health, and the lengthning of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59944:105"/>our days; ſuch as temperance and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity and moderation of our paſſions. And the contrary vices to theſe do apparently tend to the impairing of mens health and the ſhortning of their days. How many have waſted and conſum'd their bodies by luſt, and brought grievous pains and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſeaſes upon themſelves. See how the wiſe man deſcribes the ſad conſequences of this ſin, <hi>He goes as an Oxe to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till a dart ſtrike through his Liver;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 7.22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>as a Bird haſteneth to the ſnare, and knoweth not that it is for his life;</hi> and v. 25, 26, 27. <hi>Let not thy heart decline to her ways, go not aſtray in her paths; for ſhe hath caſt down many wounded; yea many young men hath been ſlain by her; her houſe is the way to Hell</hi> (that is to the grave) <hi>going down to the chambers of death.</hi> How many have been ruin'd by intemperance and exceſs, and moſt unnaturally have perverted thoſe bleſſings which God hath given for the ſupport of nature to the overthrow and deſtruction of it? How often hath mens malice and envy and diſcontent againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers terminated in a cruel revenge upon themſelves? How many by the wild fury and extravagancy of their own paſſions have put their bodies into a combuſtion, and fir'd their ſpirits; and by ſtirring up their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59944:106"/>rage and choler againſt others have arm'd that fierce humour againſt themſelves?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to our eſtates, Religion is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a mighty advantage to men in that reſpect. Not only in regard of God's more eſpecial providence and peculiar bleſſing which uſually attends good men in their undertakings and crowns them with good ſucceſs, but alſo from the nature of the thing. And this, I doubt not, is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe expreſſions of the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> concerning the temporal benefits and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of wiſedom or Religion;<note place="margin">Pro. 3.16</note> 
               <hi>In her left hand are riches and honour;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 8.21</note> 
               <hi>They that love me ſhall inherit ſubſtance, and I will fill their treaſures;</hi> and this Religion prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally does, by charging men with truth and fidelity and juſtice in their dealings, which are a ſure way of thriving and will hold out when all fraudulent arts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices will fail. And this alſo <hi>Solomon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to us; <hi>He that walketh uprightly walketh ſurely,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 10.9</note> 
               <hi>but he that perverteth his way ſhall be known;</hi> his indirect dealing will be diſcover'd one time or other, and then loſes his reputation, and his intereſt ſinks. Falſhood and deceit onely ſerve a preſent turn, and the conſequence of them is pernicious; but truth and fidelity are of laſting advantage;<note place="margin">Pro. 10.5.</note> 
               <hi>The righteous hath an
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59944:106"/>everlaſting foundation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 12.19.</note> 
               <hi>The lip of truth is eſtabliſhed for ever, but a lying tongue is but for a moment.</hi> And Religion does likewiſe engage men to diligence and induſtry in their Callings, and how much this condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the advancement of mens fortunes daily experience teaches, and the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> hath told us, <hi>The diligent hand makes rich;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 10.4.</note> and again, <hi>Seeſt thou a man diligent in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, he ſhall ſtand before Princes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 22.19.</note> 
               <hi>he ſhall not ſtand before mean perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And where men by reaſon of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult circumſtances of their condition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not arrive to any eminency of eſtate, yet Religion makes a compenſation for this by teaching men to be contented with that moderate and competent fortune which God hath given them. For the ſhorteſt way to be rich is not by enlarging our eſtates, but by contracting our deſires. What <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays of Philoſophy, is much more true of Religion, <hi>praeſtat opes ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia, quas cuicunque fecit ſupervacuas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> it makes all thoſe rich to whom it makes riches ſuperfluous, and they are ſo to thoſe who are taught by Religion to be contented with ſuch a portion of them as God's Providence hath thought fit to allot to them</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to our reputation. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59944:107"/>gives a man a more firm and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd reputation among wiſe and ſerious perſons (whoſe judgment is onely valuable) than a prudent and ſubſtantial Piety. This doth many times command reverence and eſteem from the worſer ſort of men, and ſuch as are no great friends to Religion; and ſometimes the force of truth will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort an acknowledgment of its excellency, even from its greateſt enemies. I know very well that good men may, and often do, blemiſh the reputation of their piety by over-acting ſome things in Religion; by an indiſcreet zeal about things wherein Religion is not concerned, by an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full auſterity and ſowerneſs which Religion doth not require; by little affectations, and an imprudent oftentation of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but a ſubſtantial and ſolid, a diſcreet and unaffected piety, which makes no great noiſe and ſhow, but expreſſes it ſelf in a conſtant and ſerious devotion, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the fruits of goodneſs and kindneſs and righteouſneſs towards men, will not onely give a man a credit and value among the ſober and the vertuous, but even among the vicious and more degenerate ſort of men. Upon this account it is that the Apoſtle adviſeth Chriſtians, if they would recommend
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59944:107"/>themſelves to the eſteem of God and men, earneſtly to mind the weighty and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of Religion; <hi>Let not then your good be evil ſpoken of; for the Kingdom of God is not meats and drinks, but righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; for he that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed, there are ſome perſons of ſo profligate a temper, and of ſuch an inveterate enmity to all goodneſs, as to ſcorn and reproach even Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue it ſelf. But the reproach of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons does not really wound a man's reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For why ſhould any man be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the contumelies of thoſe whoſe judgment deſerves not to be valued, who deſpiſe goodneſs and good men out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and ignorance? If theſe reproaches which they caſt upon them were the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſe and ſober men, a man's repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation might be concern'd in them; but they are the raſh words of inconſiderate and injudicious men, the extravagant ſpeeches of thoſe who are unexperienc'd in the things they ſpeak againſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wiſe man will be troubl'd at them, or think either Religion or himſelf diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by them.</p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:59944:108"/>
            <p n="4">4. As to our Relations. Religion alſo conduceth to the happineſs of theſe, as it derives a large and extenſive bleſſing upon all that belongs to us; the goodneſs of God being ſo diffuſive as to ſcatter his bleſſings <hi>round about the habitations of the juſt,</hi> and <hi>to ſhew mercy unto thouſands of them that love him and keep his Commandments.</hi> So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Pſal. 112.1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed is the man that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his Commandments; His ſeed ſhall be mighty upon earth, The generation of the upright ſhall be bleſſed? Wealth and riches are in his houſe, and his righteouſneſs endureth for ever.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 13.22.</note> And ſo <hi>Solomon; A good man leaveth an inheritance to his Childrens Children;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 14.26.</note> and again, <hi>In the fear of the Lord is ſtrong confidence, and his Children ſhall have a place of refuge.</hi> But the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives a curſe upon all that is related to him, he is ſaid <hi>to trouble his own houſe;</hi> and again,<note place="margin">Prov. 11.29.</note> 
               <hi>The wicked are overthrown and are not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 12.7.</note> 
               <hi>but the houſe of the righteous ſhall ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſetting aſide the conſideration of God's Providence, Religion doth likewiſe in its own nature tend to the welfare of thoſe who are related to us; becauſe it lays the ſtricteſt obligations upon men to take care of their Families and Relations,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59944:108"/>and to make the beſt proviſion both for their comfortable ſubſiſtance here in this world and their ſalvation in the next. And thoſe who neglect thoſe duties the Scripture is ſo far from eſteeming them Chriſtians that it accounts them worſe than Heathens and Infidels,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.8.</note> 
               <hi>He that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not for his own, eſpecially thoſe of his own houſe, is worſe than an Infidel, and hath deny'd the faith.</hi> This I know is ſpoken in reſpect of temporal proviſion, but it holds <hi>à fortiori</hi> as to the care of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is many times ſeen that the poſterity of holy and good men, eſpecially of ſuch as have evidenc'd their piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God by bounty and charity to men, have met with unuſual kindneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from others, and have by a ſtrange and ſecret diſpoſition of Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence been unexpectedly car'd and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for; and that, as they have all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world to believe, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and for the ſake of the piety and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Parents. This <hi>David</hi> tells us from his own particular obſervation;<note place="margin">Pſ. 37.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not ſeen the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging bread.</hi> And that by the <hi>righteous</hi> is here meant the <hi>good and mercifull man</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59944:109"/>from the deſcription of him in the next words,<note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> 
               <hi>He is ever merciful and len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and his ſeed is bleſſed.</hi> And on the contrary, the poſterity of the wicked do many times inherit the fruit of their fathers ſins and vices; and that not onely by a juſt judgment of God, but from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral courſe and conſequence of things. And in this ſenſe that expreſſion in <hi>Job</hi> is often verifi'd, that <hi>God lays up the iniquity of wicked men for their Children.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 21.19.</note> And doth not experience teſtifie that the intemperate and unjuſt do many times tranſmit their bodily infirmities and diſeaſes to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and entail a ſecret curſe upon their eſtates, which does either inſenſibly waſte and conſume it, or eat out the heart and comfort of it? Thus you ſee how Religion in all reſpects conduces to the happineſs of this life.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Religion and Vertue do likewiſe moſt certainly and directly tend to the eternal happineſs and ſalvation of men in the other world. And this is incomparably the greateſt advantage that redounds to men by being Religious, in compariſon of which all temporal conſiderations <hi>are leſs than nothing and vanity.</hi> The worldly advantages that Religion brings to men
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59944:109"/>in this preſent life are a ſenſible recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Religion even to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and meaneſt ſpirits: But to thoſe who are rais'd above ſenſe and aſpire after immortality, who believe the perpetual duration of their ſouls and the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their bodies; to thoſe who are throughly convinc'd of the inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of this ſhort dying life and of all the concernments of it, in compariſon of that eternal ſtate which remains for us in another life; to theſe, I ſay, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of a future happineſs and of thoſe unſpeakable and everlaſting rewards which ſhall then be given to holineſs and vertue, is certainly the moſt powerfull motive and the moſt likely to prevail upon them. For thoſe who are perſwaded that they ſhall continue for ever cannot chuſe but aſpire after a happineſs commenſurate to their duration, nor can any thing that is conſcious to its ſelf of its own immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be ſatisfyed and contented with any thing leſs than the hopes of an endleſs feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. And this hope Religion alone gives men, and the Chriſtian Religion onely can ſettle men in a firm and unſhaken aſſurance of it. But becauſe all men who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd any Religion have conſented to theſe principles, of the <hi>immortality of the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59944:110"/>ſoul</hi> and the <hi>recompences of another world,</hi> and have always promis'd to themſelves ſome rewards of piety and vertue after this life; and becauſe I did more particularly deſign from this <hi>Text</hi> to ſpeak of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral benefits and adavantages which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to men from Religion, therefore I ſhall content my ſelf to ſhew very briefly how a religious and vertuous life doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to our future happineſs. And that upon theſe two accounts; from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, and from the nature of the thing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the promiſe of God.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath the promiſe of the life that is to come.</hi> God hath all along in the Scripture ſuſpended the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternal life upon this condition. He hath peremptorily declar'd that without obedience and holineſs of life no man ſhall ever ſee the Lord. And this very thing, that it is the conſtitution and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, might be argument enough to us (if there were no other) to convince us of the neceſſity of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laws of God in order to our happineſs, and to perſwade us thereunto. For eternal life is the gift of God, and he may do what he will with his own. He is maſter of his own favours and may
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59944:110"/>diſpenſe them upon what terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he pleaſes. But it is no hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he hath impoſed upon us. If Religion brought no advantages to us in this world, yet the happineſs of heaven is ſo great as will abundantly recompence all our pains and endeavours; there is temptation enough in the reward to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage any man in the work. Had God thought fit to have impos'd the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and difficult things upon us, ought we not to have ſubmitted to them and to have undertaken them with cheerfulneſs upon ſuch great and glorious encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? As <hi>Naaman</hi>'s ſervants ſaid to him in another caſe, <hi>Had he bid thee doe ſome great thing wouldeſt thou not have done it?</hi> So if God had ſaid that without poverty and actual martyrdom <hi>no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> would not any man that believes heaven and hell and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands what theſe words ſignifie and what it is to eſcape extream and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal miſery, and to enjoy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and endleſs glory, have been willing to accept theſe conditions? <hi>How much more, when he hath onely ſaid, waſh and be clean;</hi> and <hi>Let every man that hath this hope in Him, purifie himſelf as he is pure?</hi> But God hath
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59944:111"/>not dealt thus with us, nor is the impoſing of this condition of eternal life a meer arbitrary conſtitution, therefore I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> That a Religious and Holy life doth from the very nature and reaſon of the thing conduce to our future happineſs, by way of neceſſary diſpoſition and preparation of us for it. We cannot be otherwiſe happy but by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to God, without this we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly love him nor find any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or happineſs in communion with him. For we cannot love a nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our own, nor delight to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with it. Therefore Religion, in order to the fitting of us for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the next life, does deſign to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our luſts and paſſions, and to reſtrain us from the inordinate love of the groſs and ſenſual delights of this world; to call off our minds from theſe inferiour things, and to raiſe them to higher and more ſpiritual objects, that we may be diſpoſed for the happineſs of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, and taught not to reliſh the delights of it; whereas ſhould we ſet our hearts onely upon theſe things, and be able to taſte no pleaſure in any thing but what is ſenſual and earthly, we
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59944:111"/>muſt needs be extremely miſerable when we come into the other world, becauſe we ſhould meet with nothing to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our ſelves withall, no employment ſuitable to our diſpoſition, no pleaſure that would agree with our deprav'd ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and vicious inclinations. All that Heaven and Happineſs ſignifies is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to a wicked man, and therefore could be no felicity to him. But this I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more fully to in my laſt Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>From all that hath been ſaid, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of Religion clearly appears which tends ſo directly to the happineſs of men, and is upon all accounts calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for our benefit. Let but all things be truly conſidered and caſt up and it will be found that there is no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to any man from an irreligious and vicious courſe of life. I challenge any one to inſtance in any real benefit that ever came to him this way. Let the ſinner declare what he hath found by experience. Hath lewdneſs and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance been more for his health than if he had liv'd chaſtly and ſoberly? Hath falſehood and injuſtice prov'd at the long run more for the advancement and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59944:112"/>ſecurity of his eſtate than truth and honeſty would have done? Hath any vice that he hath lived in made him more true friends, and gain'd him a better reputation in the world than the practice of holineſs and vertue would have done? Hath he found <hi>that</hi> peace and ſatisfaction of mind in an evil courſe, and <hi>that</hi> quiet enjoyment of himſelf, and comfortable aſſurance of God's favour, and good hopes of his future condition, which a religious and vertuous life would have not ſome of his vices weaken'd his body and broken his health, have not others diſſipated his eſtate and reduc'd him to want? What notorious vice is there that doth not blemiſh a man's reputation, and make him either hated or deſpis'd, and that not only by the wiſe and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous but even by the generality of men? But was ever any wicked man free from the ſtings of a guilty conſcience and the torment of a reſtleſs and uneaſie mind, from the ſecret dread of Divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and of the vengeance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world? Let the ſinner freely ſpeak the very inward ſenſe of his ſoul in this matter, and ſpare not; and I doubt not, if he will deal clearly and impartially, but
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59944:112"/>that he will acknowledge all this to be true, and is able to confirm it from his own ſad experience. For this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fruit of ſin and the preſent revenge which it takes upon ſinners, beſides that fearful puniſhment which ſhall be inflicted on them in another life.</p>
            <p>What reaſon then can any man pretend againſt Religion, when it is ſo apparently for the benefit not onely of humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety but of every particular perſon; when there is no real intereſt of this world but may ordinarily be as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally promoted and purſued no as great advantage, nay uſually to far greater, by a man that <hi>lives ſoberly and righteouſly and godly in the world,</hi> than by any one that leads the contrary courſe of life? Let no man then ſay, with thoſe prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.14.</note> 
               <hi>It is in vain to ſerve the Lord, and what profit is it that we have kept his Commandments?</hi> God has not been ſo hard a maſter to us that we have reaſon thus to complain of him. He hath given us no Laws but what are for our good, nay ſo gracious hath he been to us as to link together our duty and our intereſt, and to make thoſe very things the inſtances of our obedience which are the natural means and cauſes of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59944:113"/>The Devil was ſo far in the right, when he charg'd <hi>Job</hi> that he did not <hi>ſerve God for nought.</hi> 'Tis he himſelf that is the hard maſter and makes men ſerve him for nought, who rewards his drudges and ſlaves with nothing but ſhame and ſorrow and miſery. But God requires no man's ſervice upon hard and unreaſonable terms. The greateſt part of our work is a preſent reward to it ſelf, and for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe we do or ſuffer for him, he offers us abundant conſideration. And if men did but truly and wiſely love themſelves they would upon this very ground if there were no other, become Religious. For when all is done there is no man can ſerve his own intereſt better than by ſerving God. Religion conduceth both to our preſent and future happineſs, and when the Goſpel chargeth us with piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and juſtice and charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, and temperance and chaſtity in reference to our ſelves, the true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of theſe Laws is this, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of men in order to their eternal happineſs that they ſhould do thoſe things which tend to their temporal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, that is in plainer words, he promiſes to make us happy for ever upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we will but do that which is beſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59944:113"/>for our ſelves in this world. To conclude, Religion is founded in the intereſt of men rightly apprehended. So that if <hi>the God of this world</hi> and the luſts of men did not <hi>blind their eyes,</hi> ſo as to render them unfit to diſcern their true intereſt, it would be impoſſible, ſo long as men love themſe ves and deſire their own happineſs to keep them from being religious; for they could not but conclude that to be their intereſt, and being ſo convinc'd they would reſolve to purſue it and ſtick to it.</p>

            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> makes a compariſon between the Jewiſh and the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhews the Chriſtian to be in truth and ſubſtance what the Jewiſh was onely in type and ſhadow, v. 3. <hi>We are the Circumciſion which worſhip God in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> And then he enumerates the ſeveral priviledges he was partaker of by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his being born in the Jewiſh Church, v. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Though I might alſo have confidence in the fleſh, if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might truſt in the fleſh, I more; circumciſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. And yet he tells us he was contented to forgoe all theſe advantages for Chriſt and the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59944:115"/>Chriſtian Religion, v. 7. <hi>But what things were gain to me thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt.</hi> And not onely theſe, but if there were any thing elſe that men value in this world he was willing to hazard that alſo upon the ſame account, v. 8. <hi>Yea doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words the Apoſtle declares the high eſteem he had for the Chriſtian Religion which he calls the <hi>knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus</hi> his <hi>Lord;</hi> the excellency whereof appear'd ſo great to him that he valued nothing in compariſon of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which he had by the knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>My deſign at this time from this Text is to repreſent the excellency of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Chriſtian Religion above that of any other Religion or Inſtitution in the world. And here I ſhall not conſider the external evidence which we have of the truth of Chriſtianity and of the Divinity of its doctrine, in which reſpect it hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably the advantage of any other Religion: but onely the internal excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Doctrine it ſelf, abſtracting from the Divine authority of it: And that in theſe four reſpects:</p>
            <pb n="181" facs="tcp:59944:115"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As it does more clearly reveal to us the nature of God, which is the great foundation of all Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it give us a more certain and perfect Law for the government of our lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it propounds to us more powerfull Arguments to perſwade men to the obedience of this Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As it furniſhes us with better motives and conſiderations to patience and contentedneſs under the evils and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this life. Now theſe are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantages that any Religion can have, To give men right apprehenſions of God, a perfect rule of good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ife, and efficacious arguments to perſwade men to be good, and patiently to bear the evils and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this life. And theſe ſhall be the heads of my following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Chriſtian Religion doth more clearly reveal to us the nature of God, than any Religion ever did. And to have right apprehenſions of God is the great foundation of all Religion. For according as mens notions of God are ſuch will their Religion be. If men have groſs and falſe conceptions of God their Religion will
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59944:116"/>be abſurd and ſuperſtitious. If men fancy God to be an ill-natur'd Being arm'd with infinite power, one that delights in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and ruine of his creatures and is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take all advantages againſt them, they may fear him but they will bate him; and they will be apt to be ſuch to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another as they fancy God to be towards them, for all Religion doth naturally incline men to imitate him whom they worſhip.</p>
            <p>Now the Chriſtian Religion gives us a more perfect, and a more lovely character of God than any Religion ever did. It repreſents him to us as a pure ſpirit, (which the Heathens did not generally believe) and that he is to be worſhip'd in ſuch a manner as is moſt ſuitable to his ſpiritual nature, (which not onely the Heathens but even the Jews themſelves were extremely miſtaken about) <hi>God is a ſpirit</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> It is true indeed God himſelf did command ſacrifices to the Jews, and all thoſe external and troubleſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of which their Religion did conſiſt: But then it is to be conſider'd, that he did not inſtitute this way of Worſhip becauſe it was moſt ſuitable to his own nature,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59944:116"/>but becauſe of the carnality of their hearts and the proneneſs of that people to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. God did not preſcribe theſe things becauſe they were beſt, but becauſe the temper of that People would then admit of nothing better. And this the Scripture gives us ſeveral intimations of,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.16.</note> 
               <hi>Thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt not ſacrifice, thou delighteſt not in burnt-offerings,</hi> ſaith <hi>David:</hi> And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where more expreſly to this purpoſe; <hi>I ſpake not unto your Fathers</hi> (ſays God by the prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>) <hi>nor commanded them, in the day that I brought them forth out of the Land of Egypt, concerning burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings and ſacrifices; but this thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded I them, ſaying, Obey my voice:</hi> A ſufficient intimation that God did not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily intend to appoint this way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to impoſe it upon them as that which was moſt proper and agreeable to him, but that he condeſcended to it as moſt accommodate to their preſent ſtate and inclination. And in this ſenſe alſo ſome underſtand what God ſays to the ſame people by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 20.25.</note> that he <hi>gave them ſtatutes that were not good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Chriſtian Religion gives a more perfect, ſo a more amiable and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly character of the Divine nature. No
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59944:117"/>Religion that ever was in the world does ſo fully repreſent the goodneſs of God and his tender love to mankind, which is the beſt and moſt powerfull argument to the love of God. The Heathens did ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally dread God, and looked upon him as fierce and cruel and revengefull; and therefore they endeavoured to appeaſe him by the horrid and barbarous ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men, and of their own children. And all along in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> God is generally repreſented as very ſtrict and ſevere. But there are no where ſo plain and full declarations of his mercy and love to the ſons of men as are made in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> In the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> God is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſtyl'd <hi>the Lord of Hoſts, the great and the terrible God:</hi> But in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> he is repreſented to us by milder ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, <hi>the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the father of mercies, and the God of all conſolations; the God of all patience, the God of love and peace;</hi> nay he is ſaid to be <hi>love</hi> it ſelf and to <hi>dwell in love.</hi> And this difference between the ſtyle of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is ſo remarkable, that one of the greateſt <hi>Sects</hi> in the Primitive Church (I mean that of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi>) did upon this very ground found their <hi>hereſie</hi> of two Gods; the <hi>one</hi> evil and fierce and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59944:117"/>cruel, whom they call'd the God of the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> the <hi>other</hi> good and kind and mercifull, whom they call'd the God of the <hi>New.</hi> So great a difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the repreſentations which are made of God in the Books of the Jewiſh and the Chriſtian Religion, as to give at leaſt ſome colour and pretence for an imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of two Gods.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Chriſtian Religion hath given us a more certain and perfect Law for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our lives. It hath made our duty more plain and certain in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, than either the Philoſophy of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> or the precepts of <hi>Moſes</hi> had done. It commands univerſal love and kindneſs and good will among men, a readineſs to forgive our greateſt enemies, <hi>to doe good to them that hate us, to bleſs them that curſe us,</hi> and <hi>to pray for them that deſpitefully uſe us and perſecute us.</hi> And does incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate theſe precepts more vehemently, and forbid malice and hatred and revenge and contention more ſtrictly and peremptorily than any Religion ever did before: as will appear to any one that does but attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read our <hi>Saviour's Sermon upon the Mount.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:59944:118"/>
            <p>And as Chriſtianity hath given us a more <hi>certain</hi> ſo likewiſe a more <hi>perfect</hi> Law for the government of our lives. All the precepts of it are reaſonable and wiſe, requiring ſuch duties of us as are ſuitable to the light of nature and do approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the beſt reaſon of mankind, ſuch as have their foundation in the nature of God, and are an imitation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine excellencies, ſuch as tend to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection of humane nature and to raiſe the minds of men to the higheſt pitch of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vertue. The Laws of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are ſuch as are generally uſefull and beneficial to the world, as do tend to the outward peace and the health, to the inward comfort and contentment, and to the univerſal happineſs of mankind. They command nothing that is unneceſſary and burdenſome, as were the numerous rites and ceremonies of the Jewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but what is reaſonable, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſubſtantial: And they omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may tend to the glory of God or the welfare of men, nor do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us in any thing but what is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry either to the regular inclinations of nature or to our reaſon and true inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. They forbid us nothing but what is baſe and unworthy, to ſerve our humours
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59944:118"/>and paſſions, to reproach our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and to make our ſelves fools and beaſts; in a word, nothing but what tends either to our private harm and prejudice, or to publick diſorder and confuſion.</p>
            <p>And that this is the tenour of the Laws of the Goſpel will appear to any one from our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Sermons and Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: particularly that upon the Mount; wherein he charges his Diſciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to be humble, and meek, and righteous, and patient under ſufferings and perſecutions, and good and kind to all even to thoſe that are evil and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to us, and to endeavour to excell in all goodneſs and vertue. This will appear likewiſe from the Writings of the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; I will inſtance but in ſome few paſſages in them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> repreſents to us the deſign of the Chriſtian doctrine in a very few words, but of admirable ſenſe and weight;<note place="margin">Tit. 2.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>The grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſalvation hath appear'd to all men, teaching us that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts we ſhould live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle makes this the main and fundamental condition of the Covenant of the Goſpel on our part,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19.</note>, <hi>Let every one
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59944:119"/>that names the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> deſcribes the Chriſtian doctrine (which he calls <hi>the wiſdom that is from above</hi>) by theſe characters, <hi>It is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle and eaſie to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocriſie.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the Goſpel,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and vertue; whereby</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are given unto us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of a divine nature having eſcap'd the corruption that is in the world through luſt;</hi> and upon this conſideration he exhorts them <hi>to give all diligence to add to their faith</hi> the ſeveral vertues of a good life,<note place="margin">V. 5, 6, 7.</note> without which he tells them <hi>they are barren and unfruitfull in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I will conclude with that full and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive paſlage of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians, Whatſoever things are true, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are honeſt,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are of venerable eſteem) <hi>whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure</hi> (or chaſt) <hi>whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report, if there be any vertue, if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:59944:119"/>
            <p>But the perfection and the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Laws of Chriſtianity will moſt plainly appear by taking a brief ſurvey of them. And they may all be referr'd to theſe two general heads. They are either ſuch as tend to the perfection of humane nature and to make men ſingly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally good, or ſuch as tend to the peace and happineſs of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such as tend to the perfection of humane nature and to make men good ſingly and perſonally conſider'd. And the precepts of this kind may be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted likewiſe into two ſorts, ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn piety towards God, or ſuch as require the good order and government of our ſelves in reſpect of the enjoyments and pleaſures of this life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as enjoyn Piety towards God. All the duties of Chriſtian Religion which reſpect God are no other but what natural light prompts men to, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the two Sacraments (which are of great uſe and ſignificancy in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion) and praying to God in the name and by the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. For the ſum of natural Religion as it refers more immediately to God is this, That we ſhould inwardly reverence
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59944:120"/>and love God, and that we ſhould expreſs our inward reverence and love of him by external worſhip and adoration, and by our readineſs to receive and obey all the revelations of his will: And that we ſhould teſtifie our dependence upon him, and our confidence of his goodneſs, by conſtant prayers and ſupplications to him for mercy and help for our ſelves and others; And that we ſhould acknowledge our obligations to him for the many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and benefits which every day and every minute we receive from him, by continual praiſes and thankſgivings: And that on the contrary we ſhould not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any unworthy thoughts of God, nor give that honour and reverence which is due to him, to any other; that we ſhould not worſhip him in any manner that is either unſuitable to the excellency and perfection of his nature, or contrary to his revealed will; that we ſhould care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid the prophane and irreverent uſe of his Name by curſing, or cuſtomary ſwearing, and take heed of the neglect or contempt of his Worſhip or any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it. This is the ſum of the firſt part of natural Religion, and theſe are the general heads of thoſe duties which every man's reaſon tells him he owes to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59944:120"/>God: And theſe are the very things which the Chriſtian Religion does expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us, as might be evidenc'd from particular Texts in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> So that there is nothing in this part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity but what agrees very well with the reaſon of mankind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such precepts as require the good order and government of our ſelves in reſpect of the pleaſures and enjoyments of this life. Chriſtian Religion commands whatſoever things are pure and chaſt, all manner of ſobriety and temperance and moderation in reference to our appetites and paſſion; and forbids whatever is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and unreaſonable, and unhealthfull in the uſe of pleaſures and of any of God's creatures. Hither belong all thoſe Texts which require of us that we ſhould <hi>not walk after the fleſh but after the ſpirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> that we ſhould <hi>cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> that we ſhould <hi>be holy in all manner of converſation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.15.</note> St. <hi>John</hi> diſtributes the luſts and irregular appetites of men into three kinds, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs, covetouſneſs, and ambition, anſwerably to the three ſorts of tempting objects that are in the world, pleaſures, riches and honours, <hi>All that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.16.</note> 
               <hi>the luſt of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59944:121"/>eyes, and the pride of life,</hi> &amp;c. And Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity doth ſtrictly forbid all theſe,<note place="margin">Luke 12.15.</note> 
               <hi>Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs</hi> (ſays our Saviour, and he adds this excellent reaſon) <hi>for a man's life conſiſteth not in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi> It forbids pride and ambition and vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and commands humility and modeſty and condeſcenſion to others;<note place="margin">Mat. 11.29.</note> 
               <hi>Learn of me</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>for I am meek and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſpirit;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.16.</note> 
               <hi>Mind not high things, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to them that are of low degree; Let nothing be done through vain glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.3.</note> 
               <hi>but in lowlineſs of mind let each eſteem other better than themſelves.</hi> And in reference to ſenſual pleaſures it forbids all irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and exceſs, and ſtrictly enjoyns pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and temperance;<note place="margin">Luke 21.36.</note> cautioning us <hi>to take heed leſt we be overcharged with ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drunkenneſs;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.13.</note> chargeing us <hi>to walk decently as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenneſs, not in chambering and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>to abſtain from fleſhly luſts which war againſt the ſoul.</hi> Now all theſe precepts do not onely tend to beget in us ſuch vertues and diſpoſitions as are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and ſuitable to our nature and every way for our temporal conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and advantage, but ſuch as do likewiſe exceedingly diſpoſe us to piety
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59944:121"/>and religion by purifying our ſouls from the droſs and filth of ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. For covetouſneſs debaſeth a man's ſpirit, and ſinks it into the earth; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and luſt cloud a man's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and indiſpoſe it for the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of things ſpiritual and divine. Thus you ſee how the Precepts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity do tend to the perfection of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, conſidering men ſingly and perſonally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other ſort of Precepts are ſuch as tend to the peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of humane Society. And the reaſon of mankind can deviſe nothing more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this end than the Laws of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are. For they command all thoſe vertues which are apt to ſweeten the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and allay the paſſions and animoſities of men one towards another. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us <hi>to love our neighbour</hi> (that is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in the world, even our greateſt enemies) <hi>as our. ſelves.</hi> And for this end among others was the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> the Feaſt of love inſtituted: that by commemorating the love of our dying Saviour, who laid down his life for his enemies, we might be put in mind how we ought to love one another.</p>
            <p>And by this Law of loving all men
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59944:122"/>even our enemies, Chriſtian Religion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelf not onely to be the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and harmleſs, but the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and beſt natur'd Inſtitution that ever was in the world. For in purſuance of this general precept it commands us, <hi>to do good to all men; if it be poſſible, and as much as in us lies to live peaceably with all men;</hi> to be <hi>kind one to another,</hi> ready to gratifie and oblige men; to be <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted</hi> and compaſſionate towards thoſe that are in want or miſery, and ready to ſupply and relieve them; to ſympathize with one another in our joys and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, <hi>to mourn with thoſe that mourn, and to rejoyce with them that rejoyce; to bear one anothers burdens, and to forbear one another in love;</hi> to be eaſily reconcil'd to them that have offended us, and to be ready to <hi>forgive from our hearts</hi> the greateſt injuries that can be done to us, and that without bounds and limits <hi>even to ſeventy ſeven times;</hi> as our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it.</p>
            <p>The Laws of Chriſtianity do likewiſe ſecure both the private intereſts of men and the publick peace, by confirming and enforcing all the dictates of nature concerning Juſtice and Equity, and our doing to others as we would have them
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59944:122"/>to do to us; and by commanding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to humane Laws which decide mens rights and ſubmiſſion to government under pain of damnation: And by forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatever is contrary to theſe, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and oppreſſion defrauding and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching one another, perfidiouſneſs and treachery, breach of truſts, oaths or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, undutifulneſs to ſuperiours, ſedition and rebellion againſt Magiſtracy and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: And if there be any thing elſe that is apt to diſturb the peace of the world and to alienate the affections of men from one another, as ſowerneſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and rudeneſs of behaviour, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriouſneſs and ſiniſter interpretation of things, all croſs and diſtaſtfull humours, and what ever elſe may render the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of men grievous and uneaſie to one another: All theſe are either expreſly, or by clear conſequence and deduction for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the new Teſtament.</p>
            <p>And now what could any Religion do more towards the reforming of the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and manners of men? What Laws can be devis'd more proper and effectual to advance the nature of man to its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection, to procure the tranquillity of mens minds and the peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the world, than theſe precepts of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59944:123"/>Chriſtianity are? Several of which (as thoſe of <hi>loving our enemies,</hi> of <hi>not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging injuries,</hi> of <hi>rendering good for evil,</hi> &amp;c.) though they have been eſteem'd reaſonable by ſome of the wifeſt among the Heathen, yet by reaſon of the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy of the world, and of the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and uncertainty of humane reaſon, they never obtain'd to have the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and force of natural Laws. So that we owe to Chriſtianity the diſcovery of the moſt certain and perfect Rule of life that ever the world was acquainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Chriſtian Religion propounds the moſt powerfull arguments to perſwade men to the obedience of theſe Laws. The Goſpel offers ſuch conſiderations to us, as are fit to work very forceably upon two of the moſt ſwaying and governing paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the mind of man, our hopes and our fears. To encourage our hopes it gives us the higheſt aſſurance of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt laſting happineſs, in caſe of obedience; and to awaken our fear it threatens ſinners with the moſt dreadfull and durable torments, in caſe of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well-doing ſeek for glory and honour and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59944:123"/>immortality,</hi> it promiſeth <hi>eternal life: But unto them that obey not the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs,</hi> it threatens <hi>indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh.</hi> And this is that which makes the doctrine of the Goſpel ſo powerfull an inſtrument for the reforming of the world, that it propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to men ſuch glorious rewards and ſuch terrible puniſhments as no Religion ever did; and to make the conſideration of them more effectual, it gives us far greater aſſurance of the reality, and certainty of theſe things than ever the world had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This account the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives us of the ſucceſs and efficacy of the Goſpel upon the minds of men, and for this reaſon he calls it <hi>the power of God unto ſalvation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. r. 16.18.</note> becauſe therein <hi>the wrath of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd from Heaven againſt all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi> Before the revelation of the Goſpel the wickedneſs and impenitency of the Heathen-world was a much more excuſable thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were in a great meaſure igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the rewards of another life, and had generally but very uncertain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure apprehenſions of thoſe things which urge men moſt powerfully to forſake their ſins, and are the moſt prevalent arguments to a good life. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:59944:124"/>the moſt knowing among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,<note place="margin">Act. 17.30, 31.</note> 
               <hi>The times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men every where to repent; becauſe he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead.</hi> The Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> from the dead hath given the world that full aſſurance of another life after this and of a future Judgment which it never had before, for <hi>He</hi> whom God rais'd from the dead did declare and teſtifie that <hi>it was he who was ordain'd of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 10.42.</note> And the firm belief of a future Judgment, which ſhall <hi>render to every man according to his deeds,</hi> if it be well conſider'd, is to a reaſonable nature the moſt forcible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of all other to a good life; becauſe it is taken from the conſideration of the greateſt and moſt laſting happineſs and miſery that humane nature is capable of. So that the Laws of Chriſtianity have the firmeſt ſanction of any Laws in the world to ſecure the obedience and obſervance of them: For what can reſtrain men from ſin if the terrours of the Lord and the evident danger of eternal deſtruction will
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59944:124"/>not? What encouragement can be given to goodneſs beyond the hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the aſſurance of an endleſs feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Chriſtian Religion furniſheth us with the beſt motives and conſiderations to patience and contentedneſs under the evils and afflictions of this life. This was one great deſign of Philoſophy, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port men under the evils and calamities which this life is incident to, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their ſpirits againſt ſufferings. And to this end the wiſeſt among the Heathens rack'd their wits and caſt about every way, they advanc'd all ſorts of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and manag'd every little argument and conſideration to the utmoſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And yet after all theſe attempts they have not been able to give any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable comfort and eaſe to the mind of man under any of the great evils and preſſures of this life. <hi>The bed is ſhorter than that a man can ſtretch himſelf upon it, and the covering narrower than that a man can wrap himſelf in it.</hi> All the wiſe ſayings and advices which Philoſophers could muſter up to this purpoſe have prov'd ineffectual to the common people and the generality of mankind, and have help'd
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59944:125"/>onely to ſupport ſome few ſtout and oſtbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate minds, which without the aſſiſtance of Philoſophy would have held up pretty well of themſelves.</p>
            <p>Some of the Philoſophers have run ſo far back for arguments of comfort againſt, pain as to call every thing into queſtion, and to <hi>doubt</hi> whether there were any ſuch thing as ſenſe or pain. And yet for all that when any great evil has been upon them, they would <hi>certainly</hi> ſigh and groan as pitifully and cry out as loud as other men.</p>
            <p>Others have ſought to eaſe themſelves of all the evil of affliction by diſputing ſubtilly againſt it, and pertinaciouſly maintaining that afflictions are no real evils but onely in opinion and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore a wiſe man ought not to be troubl'd at them. But he muſt be a very wiſe man that can forbear being troubl'd at things that are very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. And yet thus <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> (as <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> tells us) diſtinguiſh'd, he could not deny pain to be <hi>very troubleſome</hi> but for all that he was reſolv'd, <hi>never to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be an evil.</hi> But ſure it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlender comfort that relies upon this nice diſtinction between things being <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome</hi> and being <hi>evils,</hi> when all the evil
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59944:125"/>of affliction lies in the trouble it creates to us. But when the beſt that can be is made of this argument, it is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to be thrown away as a ſtupid Paradox and againſt the common ſenſe of mankind.</p>
            <p>Others have endeavoured to delude their trouble by a graver way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that theſe things are fatal and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and therefore no body ought to be troubled at them, it being in vain to be troubled at that which we cannot help. And yet perhaps it might as reaſonably be ſaid on the other ſide that this very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, <hi>that a thing cannot be help'd,</hi> is one of the juſteſt cauſes of trouble to a wiſe man. For it were ſome kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort if theſe evils were to be avoided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then we might be carefull to prevent them another time; but if they be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary then my trouble is as fatal as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity that occaſions it, and though I know it is in vain to be troubled for that which I cannot help yet I cannot chuſe but be afflicted. It was a ſmart reply that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made to one that miniſtred this comfort to him of the fatality of things, <hi>Hoc ipſum eſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>quod me male ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> this was ſo far from giving any eaſe to his mind that <hi>this was the very thing that troubled him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="202" facs="tcp:59944:126"/>
            <p>Others have try'd to divert and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the troubles of other men by pretty and plauſible <hi>ſayings,</hi> ſuch as this, <hi>That if evils are long they are but light, if ſharp</hi> I <hi>but ſhort,</hi> and a hundred ſuch like. Now am apt to imagine that it is but a very ſmall comfort that a plain and ordinary man, lying under a ſharp fit of the Stone for a week together, receives from this fine Sentence. For what pleaſure ſoever men that are at eaſe and leiſure may take in being the Authours of witty ſayings, I doubt it is but poor conſolation that a man under great and ſtinging afflictions finds from them.</p>
            <p>The beſt moral argument to patience, in my opinion, is the advantage of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it ſelf. To bear evils as quietly as we can is the way to make them lighter and eaſier. But to toſs and fling and to be reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is good for nothing but to fret and enrage our pain, to gall our ſores and to make the burthen that is upon us ſit more uneaſie. But this is properly no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of comfort, but an art of managing our ſelves under afflictions ſo as not to make them more grievous than indeed the are.</p>
            <p>But now the arguments which Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity propounds to us are ſuch as are a juſt and reaſonable encouragement to men to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59944:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>bear ſufferings patiently. Our Religion ſets before us not the example of a ſtupid <hi>Stoick,</hi> who had by obſtinate principles harden'd himſelf againſt all ſenſe of pain beyond the common meaſures of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but an example that lies level to all mankind, of a man like our ſelves, that had a tender ſenſe of the leaſt ſuffering and yet patiently endur'd the greateſt; of <hi>Jeſus the Authour and finiſher of our faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1.22</note> 
               <hi>who for the joy that was ſet before him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> God thought it expedient that the firſt Chriſtians ſhould by great hardſhips and perſecutions be train'd up for glory, and to animate and encourage them hereto the <hi>Captain of our ſalvation was crown'd by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2.10</note> Much more ſhould the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this pattern arm us with patience againſt the common and ordinary calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this life, eſpecially if we conſider his example with this advantage that though his ſufferings were wholly undeſerv'd, and not for himſelf but for us, yet he bore them patiently.</p>
            <p>But the main conſideration of all is, the glory which ſhall follow our ſufferings as the reward of <hi>them,</hi> if they be for God and his cauſe; and if upon any other innocent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59944:127"/>as reward of our patience.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.17.</note> 
               <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Chriſtian Religion hath ſecur'd us that we ſhall be infinite gainers by our ſufferings. And who would not be content to ſuffer upon terms of ſuch advantage? <hi>to paſs through many tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations into the Kingdom of God,</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a ſhort ffliction for an endleſs happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? The aſſurance of a future bleſſedneſs is a cordial that will revive our ſpirits more in the day of adverſity, than all the wiſe ſayings and conſiderations of Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the arguments which Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity propounds to us, and they are firm and ſound at the bottom; they have ſtrength and ſubſtance in them, and are apt to work upon humane nature, and the moſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry underſtanding is capable of the force of them. In the ſtrength and vertue of this great example, and in contemplation of this glorious reward, with what reſolution and chearfulneſs, with what courage and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did vaſt numbers of all ſorts of people in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, not only men but women, not only thoſe of greater ſpirit and more generous education but thoſe of the pooreſt and loweſt condition, not onely the learned and the wiſe but the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59944:127"/>ignorant and illiterate, encounter all the rage and malice of the world and embrace torments and death? Had the precepts and counſels of Philoſophy ever any ſuch effect upon the minds of men? I will conclude this with a paſſage in the life of <hi>Lipſius,</hi> who was a great ſtudier and admirer of the <hi>Stoical</hi> Philoſophy. When he lay upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and one of his friends who came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit him told him that he needed not uſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to perſwade him to patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his pains, the Philoſophy which he had ſtudied ſo much would furniſh him with motives enough to that purpoſe, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers him with this ejaculation, <hi>Domine Jeſu, da mihi patientiam Chriſtianam, Lord Jeſus, give me Chriſtian patience.</hi> No patience like to that which the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtianity are apt to work in us.</p>
            <p>And now I have as briefly and plainly as I could endeavour'd to repreſent to you the excellency of the Chriſtian Religion, both in reſpect of the clear diſcoveries which it makes to us of the nature of God which is the great foundation of all Religion, and likewiſe in reſpect of the perfection of its Laws and the power of its arguments to perſwade men both to obey and ſuffer the will of God. By which you may ſee,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59944:128"/>what the proper tendency and deſign of this Religion is, and what the Laws and precepts of it would make men if they would truly obſerve them and live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them, ſubſtantially Religious towards God, chaſt and temperate, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and contented in reference to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the diſpenſations of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards them, juſt and honeſt, kind and peaceable and good natur'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men. In a word, the Goſpel deſcribes God to us in all reſpects ſuch a one as we would wiſh him to be, gives us ſuch Laws as every man that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands himſelf would chuſe to live by, propounds ſuch arguments to perſwade to the obedience of theſe Laws as no man that wiſely loves himſelf and hath any tenderneſs for his own intereſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs either in this world or the other, can refuſe to be mov'd withall.</p>
            <p>And now methinks I may with ſome confidence challenge any Religion in the world to ſhew ſuch a compleat body and collection of holy and reaſonable Laws eſtabliſh'd upon ſuch promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings as the Goſpel contains. And if any man can produce a Religion that can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably pretend to an equal or a greater confirmation than the Goſpel hath, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59944:128"/>the precepts and promiſes and threatnings whereof are calculated to make men wiſer and better, more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and more chaſt, more meek and more patient, more kind and more juſt, than the laws and motives of Chriſtianity are apt to make men; if any man can produce ſuch a Religion, I am ready to be of it. Let but any man ſhew me any Book in the world, the doctrines whereof have the ſeal of ſuch miracles as the doctrine of the Scriptures hath; a Book which contains the heads of our duty ſo perfectly, and without the mixture of any thing that is unreaſonable, or vicious, or any ways unworthy of God; that commands us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in reaſon neceſſary to be done, and abridgeth us of no lawfull pleaſure without offering us abundant recompence for our preſent ſelf-denyal; a Book the rules whereof, if they were practic'd, would make men more pious and devout, more holy and ſober, more juſt and fair in their dealings, better friends and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neighbours, better magiſtrates and better ſubjects and better in all relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and which does offer to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of men more powerfull argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade them to be all this; let any man, I ſay, ſhew me ſuch a Book, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59944:129"/>I will lay aſide the Scripture and preach out of <hi>that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And do we not all profeſs to be of this excellent Religion, and to ſtudy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this holy Book of the Scriptures? But alas! who will believe that we do ſo, that ſhall look upon the actions and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lives of the greateſt part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? How groſly and openly do many of us contradict the plain precepts of the Goſpel, by our ungodlineſs and worldly luſts by living intemperately or unjuſtly; or prophanely in this preſent world? As if <hi>the grace of God which brings ſalvation,</hi> had never <hi>appear'd</hi> to us, as if we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear'd of Heaven or Hell, or believ'd not one word that the Scripture ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, as if we were in no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation <hi>of the bleſſed hope and the glorious appearance of the great God and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom God hath <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to judge the world in righteouſneſs;</hi> and who will beſtow mighty rewards upon thoſe who faithfully ſerve him, but will come <hi>in flaming ſire to take vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us not then deceive our ſelves by pretending to this <hi>excellent knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> if we do not frame
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59944:129"/>our lives according to it. For though we <hi>know theſe things</hi> never ſo well, yet we are not <hi>happy</hi> unleſs <hi>we do them:</hi> Nay, we are but the more miſerable for knowing them if we do them not; Therefore it concerns every one of us to conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly what we believe; and whether our belief of the Chriſtian Religion have its due effect upon our lives. If not, all the Precepts and Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Goſpel will riſe up in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt us, and the Articles of our Faith will be ſo many Articles of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, and the great weight of our charge will be this that we did not obey that Goſpel which we profeſs'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that we made confeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith but liv'd like Heathens. Not to believe the Chriſtian Religion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo great evidence and confirmation as God hath given to it, is very unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but to believe it to be true, and yet to live as if it were falſe, is the greateſt repugnancy and contradiction that can be. He that does not believe Chriſtianity, either hath, or thinks he hath ſome reaſon for with-holding his aſſent from it. But he that believes it, and yet lives contrary to it, knows that he hath no reaſon for what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he does, and is convinc'd that he
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59944:130"/>ought to do otherwiſe: And he is a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man indeed that does thoſe things for the doing of which he continually ſtands condemn'd by his own mind, and accordingly God will deal more ſeverely with ſuch perſons. He will pardon a thouſand defects in our underſtandings, if they do not proceed from groſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and neglect of our ſelves; but the faults of our wills have no excuſe, becauſe we knew to do better and were convinc'd in our minds that we ought not to have done ſo.</p>
            <p>Doſt thou believe that <hi>the wrath of God is reveal'd from Heaven againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> and doſt thou ſtill allow thy ſelf <hi>in ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worldly luſts?</hi> Art thou convinc'd that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> and doſt thou ſtill perſiſt in a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſe? Art thou fully perſwaded that <hi>no whoremonger, nor adulterer, nor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, nor unrighteous perſon ſhall have any inheritance in the Kingdom of God and Chriſt,</hi> and doſt thou for all that continue to practiſe theſe vices? What canſt thou ſay <hi>(man)</hi> why it ſhould not be to thee according to thy faith? If it ſo fall out that thou art miſerable and undone for ever, thou haſt no reaſon to be ſurpriz'd
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59944:130"/>as if ſome unexpected thing had happen'd to thee. It is but with thee juſt as thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'dſt it would be when thou didſt theſe things. For how couldſt thou expect that God ſhould accept of thy good belief when thou didſt ſo notoriouſly contradict it by a bad life? How couldſt thou look for other but that God ſhould condemn thee for the doing of thoſe things for which thine own Conſcience did condemn thee all the while thou waſt doing of them; When we come into the other world there is no conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that will ſting our conſciences more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly than this, that we did wickedly when we knew to have done better, and choſe to make our ſelves miſerable when we underſtood the way to have been happy. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, we Chriſtians have certainly the beſt and the holieſt, the wiſeſt and moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Religion in the world; but then we are in the worſt condition of all mankind, if the beſt Religion in the world do not make us good.</p>

            <p>ONE of the great prejudices which men have entertain'd againſt the Chriſtian Religion is this, that it lays upon men <hi>heavy burdens and grievous to be born,</hi> that the Laws of it are very ſtrict and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, difficult to be kept and yet dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to be broken; That it requires us to govern and keep under our paſſions, and to contradict many times our ſtrongeſt inclinations and deſires, <hi>to cut off our right hand</hi> and <hi>to pluck out our right eye,</hi> to <hi>love cur enemies,</hi> to <hi>bleſs them that curſe us,</hi> to <hi>do good to them that hate us</hi> and to <hi>pray for them that deſpitefully uſe us and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute us;</hi> to forgive the greateſt injuries
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59944:132"/>that are done to us, and to make reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the leaſt that we do to others; to be contented with our condition patient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſufferings, and ready to ſacrifice our deareſt intereſts in this world, and even our very lives, in the cauſe of God and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: All theſe ſeem to be <hi>hard ſayings</hi> and <hi>grievous commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the removal of this prejudice I have choſen theſe words of the Apoſtle, which expreſly tells us the contrary, that <hi>the commandments of God are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though this be a great truth if it be impartially conſider'd, yet it is alſo a great paradox to men of corrupt minds and vicious practices, who are prejudic'd againſt Religion and the holy Laws of God by their intereſt and their luſts. This ſeems a ſtrange <hi>propoſition</hi> to thoſe who look upon Religion at a diſtance and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver try'd the experiment of a holy life, who meaſure the Laws of God not by the intrinſecal goodneſs and equity of them, but by the reluctancy and oppoſition which they find in their own hearts againſt them.</p>
            <p>Upon this account it will be requiſite to take ſome pains to ſatisfie the reaſon of men concerning this truth and if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59944:132"/>to make it ſo evident that thoſe who are unwilling to own it may yet be aſham'd to deny it. And methinks I have this peculiar advantage in the argument I have now undertaken that every reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man cannot chuſe but wiſh me ſucceſs in this attempt, becauſe I undertake the proof of that which it is every man's inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that it ſhould be true: And if I can make it out, this pretence againſt Religion will not onely be baffled but we ſhall gain a new and forcible argument to perſwade men over to it.</p>
            <p>Now the eaſineſs or difficulty of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of any Laws or commands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends chiefly upon theſe <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Upon the Nature of the Laws themſelves and their ſuitableneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitableneſs to thoſe to whom they are given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Upon the ability or weakneſs of thoſe on whom theſe Laws are impos'd for the keeping of them. For eaſineſs and difficulty are relative terms and refer to ſome power, and a thing may be difficult to a weak man which yet may be eaſie to the ſame perſon when aſſiſted with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Upon the encouragement that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59944:133"/>is given to the obſervation of them. For the propoſal of great rewards does very much qualifie and allay the difficulty of any undertaking.</p>
            <p>Now if I can make theſe three things evident: 1. That the Laws of God are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that is, ſuitable to our nature and advantageous to our intereſt. 2. That we are not deſtitute of ſufficient power and ability for the performance of them. And, 3. That we have the greateſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to this purpoſe: Then have we all imaginable reaſon to aſſent to the truth of this Propoſition that <hi>the commandments of God are not grievous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Laws of God are reaſonable, that is, ſuitable to our nature and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to our intereſt. 'Tis true God hath a ſoveraign right over us as we are his creatures, and by virtue of this right he might without injuſtice have impos'd diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult tasks upon us and have requir'd hard things at our hands. But in making Laws for us he hath not made uſe of this right. He hath commanded us nothing in the Goſpel that is either unſuitable to our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or prejudicial to our intereſt; nay, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is ſevere and againſt the grain of our nature, but when either the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59944:133"/>neceſſity of our intereſt does require it, or an extraordinary reward is promis'd to our obedience. <hi>He hath ſhew'd thee, O man what is good, and what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> This is the ſum of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, that we ſhould behave our ſelves reverently and obediently towards the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, and juſtly and charitably towards men; and that in order to the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of us for the better diſcharge of theſe duties, we ſhould govern our ſelves in the uſe of ſenſual delights with tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and moderation. And if we go over the Laws of Chriſtianity, we ſhall find that, excepting a very few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, they enjoyn the very ſame things; onely they have made our duty more clear and certain. But this I have had occaſion to make out largely in the foregoing <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> and therefore I ſhall ſay the leſs to it now.</p>
            <p>As to the ſeveral parts of God's worſhip and ſervice, <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>thankſgiving, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>reading</hi> the <hi>word of God,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> theſe are all no leſs for our own comfort and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage than for the honour of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And there is nothing of difficulty
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59944:134"/>or trouble in the external performance of them, but what hypocriſie can make tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to it ſelf: And certainly they muſt be not onely much more eaſie, but even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, when they are directed by our underſtandings, and accompanied with our hearts and affections.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe Laws of Religion which concern our duty to our ſelves, as <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>chaſtity;</hi> or to others, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral branches of <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in thoſe general rules, <hi>of loving our neighbour as our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>of doing to others as we would have them to do to us:</hi> There is nothing in all theſe Laws but what is moſt reaſonable and fit to be done by us, nothing but what if we were to conſult our own intereſt and happineſs, and did rightly underſtand our ſelves, we would chuſe for our ſelves; nothing but what is eaſie to be underſtood, and as eaſie to be practis'd by an honeſt and a willing mind.</p>
            <p>Now the practice of all theſe is ſuitable to our nature, and agreeable to the frame of our underſtandings; proper to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and circumſtances in this world, and preparatory to our happineſs in the next. And no man's reaſon did ever dictate to him the contrary of any of theſe; that it is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59944:134"/>fit for a Creature not to love God, to be undutifull to his great Soveraign, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull to his beſt benefactor; that it is reaſonable for a man to debauch himſelf by intemperance and brutiſh ſenſuality; to hate, defraud and oppreſs other men. Our very natural reaſon, if we will but liſten to the dictates of it, is an enemy to all theſe ſins and a law againſt all theſe vices.</p>
            <p>And as the practice of all piety and vertue is agreeable to our reaſon, ſo is it likewiſe for the intereſt of mankind; both of private perſons, and of publick Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as I have already ſhown. Some ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues plainly tend to the preſervation of our health, others to the improvement and ſecurity of our eſtates, all to the peace and quiet of our minds; and which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more ſtrange, to the advancement of our eſteem and reputation; for though the world be generally bad, and men are apt to approve nothing ſo much as what they do themſelves; yet, I know not how it comes to paſs, men are commonly ſo juſt to vertue and goodneſs, as to praiſe it in others even when they do not practiſe it themſelves.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe precepts of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which ſeem to be moſt harſh and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59944:135"/>at firſt appearance, (as <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>reſtitution, mortification</hi> of our <hi>luſts</hi> and <hi>paſſions, humility, patience</hi> and <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs</hi> with our condition, and <hi>reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our ſelves to the will of God; <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and loving our enemies,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> for the cauſe of God and Religion) if we look well into them and conſider throughly the nature and tendency of them, even theſe will appear to be both reaſonable in themſelves, and upon one account or other really for our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>What more reaſonable than <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> than that a man when he hath done amiſs and contrary to his duty ſhould be heartily ſorry for it, and reſolve to do ſo no more? And how grievous ſoever it be, it is neceſſary, being the onely way to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and peace. And in caſe our offence againſt God hath been complicated with injury to men, it is but reaſonable we ſhould make <hi>reſtitution</hi> as far as we are able, according to the nature of the injury. For without this our repentance is not real, becauſe we have not done what we can to undo our fault as much as we can, or at leaſt to hinder the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſequences of it from proceeding any farther: Nor can any man be judg'd
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59944:135"/>to be truly ſorry for his ſin that retains the profit and advantages of it to himſelf. Beſides, that till reparation be made to the utmoſt of our power we can have no peace in our own conſciences, nor any well-grounded hopes of forgiveneſs from God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mortification of our luſts and paſſions,</hi> though, like <hi>repentance,</hi> it have ſomething in it that is troubleſome, yet nothing that is unreaſonable, or really to our preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. If we give way to our Paſſions, we do but gratifie our ſelves for the preſent in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our future diſquiet; but if we reſiſt and conquer them, we lay the foundation of perpetual peace and tranquillity in our minds. If we govern our ſelves in the uſe of ſenſual delights by the Laws of God and reaſon, we ſhall find our ſelves more at eaſe than if we ſhould let looſe the reins to our appetites and luſts. For the more we gratifie our luſts the more craving they will be, and the more impatient of denial. <hi>Creſcit indulgens ſibi dirus hydrops,</hi> every luſt is a kind of hydropick diſtemper, and the more we drink the more we ſhall thirſt. So that by retrenching our inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſires we do not rob our ſelves of any true pleaſure, but onely prevent the pain and trouble of farther diſſatisfaction.</p>
            <pb n="222" facs="tcp:59944:136"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Humility,</hi> though it may ſeem to expoſe a man to ſome contempt, yet it is truly the readieſt way to honour: as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>pride</hi> is a moſt improper and abſurd means for the accompliſhing of the end it aims at. All other vices do in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure attain their end; covetouſneſs does uſually raiſe an eſtate, and ambitious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours do often advance men to high places; but pride and inſolence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of others do infallibly defeat their own deſign. They aim at reſpect and eſteem but never attain it, for all mankind do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally hate and ſlight a proud man.</p>
            <p>What more reaſonable than <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>contentedneſs,</hi> and that we ſhould in all things <hi>reſign</hi> up our ſelves to the will of God, who loves us as well as we do our ſelves, and knows what is good for us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we do our ſelves? this certainly is the beſt way to prevent anxiety and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of mind, and to make the worſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as tolerable as it can be, and much more eaſie than it would be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>As for that peculiar <hi>Law</hi> of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which forbids <hi>revenge,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to <hi>forgive injuries</hi> and to <hi>love our enemies,</hi> no man can think it grievous who conſiders the pleaſure and ſweetneſs of love and the glorious victory of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59944:136"/>evil with good, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares theſe with the reſtleſs torment and perpetual tumults of a malicious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, <hi>Self-denyal for the cauſe of God and Religion;</hi> this is neither unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nor to our diſadvantage. If we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our infinite obligations to God, we have no reaſon to think much to ſacrifice to him our deareſt intereſts in this world; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we conſider withall, how diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably great the reward of our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhall be in another world. Beſides that the intereſt of Religion is of ſo great concernment to the happineſs of mankind, that every man is bound for that reaſon to aſſert the truth of it with the hazard of any thing that is moſt valuable to him in this world.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We are not deſtitute of ſufficient power and ſtrength for the performing of God's commands. Had God given us Laws but no power to keep them, his commandments would then indeed have been grievous. 'Tis true we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a great deal of weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency by our wilfull degeneracy from goodneſs, but that grace which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel offers to us for our aſſiſtance is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for us. And this ſeems to be the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59944:137"/>reaſon why the Apoſtle ſays here in the <hi>Text</hi> that <hi>his commandments are not grievous,</hi> becauſe he offers us an aſſiſtance proportionable to the difficulty of his commands, and the neceſſity of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: for it follows immediately after the <hi>Text, for whoſoever is born of God, overcometh the world.</hi> Therefore the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi> of God <hi>are not grievous,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every Child of God, <hi>that is,</hi> every Chriſtian is endued with a power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is enabled to reſiſt and conquer the temptations of the world. The ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle elſewhere encourages Chriſtians upon the ſame conſideration, <hi>greater is he that is in you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.4.</note> 
               <hi>than he that is in the world.</hi> Though we be encompaſs'd with many and potent enemies who make it their buſineſs to tempt and to deter us from our duty, yet our caſe is not hard ſo long as we have a greater ſtrength on our ſide: And this the Apoſtle tells us is the caſe of every Chriſtian, <hi>greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</hi> Are there legions of Devils who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually deſigning and working our ruine? there are alſo myriads of good Angels who are more chearfull and officious to do us good. For I doubt not, but as thoſe who are bent to do wickedly will never
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59944:137"/>want tempters to urge them on and to puſh them forward in an evil courſe; ſo on the other hand, thoſe who apply themſelves ſeriouſly to the buſineſs of Religion, and yield themſelves tractable to good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will find the good ſpirit of God more ready and active to encourage them than the Devil can be to pull them back; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we think that God hath given a greater power and a larger commiſſion to the Devil to do men miſchief, than to his holy Spirits and his holy Angels for our aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and encouragement. But then we are to underſtand that this aſſiſtance is onely offer'd to men, and not forc'd upon them whether they will or no. For if we beg God's grace but neglect to make uſe of it, if we implore his aſſiſtance for the mortifying of our luſts but will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute our own endeavours, God will withdraw his grace and take away his holy Spirit from us. Nay, if after we have begun well we do notoriouſly ſlacken our endeavours, we forfeit the Divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: If when by God's grace we have in a good meaſure conquer'd the firſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of Religion, and gain'd ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual ſtrength againſt ſin; if after this we grow careleſs and remiſs, and neglect our guard, and lay our ſelves open to temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59944:138"/>God's Spirit will not always ſtrive with us: Notwithſtanding all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpel and the mighty aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances there offer'd to us, if we love any luſt, and will with <hi>Sampſon</hi> lay our head in <hi>Dalilah</hi>'s lap, we ſhall be inſenſibly robb'd <hi>of our ſtrength and become like other men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. We have the greateſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the obſervance of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Two things make any courſe of life eaſie; preſent pleaſure, and the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a future reward. Religion gives part of its reward in hand, the preſent comfort and ſatisfaction of having done our duty; and for the reſt, it offers us the beſt ſecurity that Heaven can give. Now theſe two muſt needs make our duty very eaſie; a conſiderable reward in hand, and not onely the hopes but the aſſurance of a far greater recompence hereafter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Preſent peace and ſatisfaction of mind, and unexpreſſible joy and pleaſure flowing from the teſtimony of a good conſcience. This is preſent payment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it is the earneſt of a future and greater happineſs. And this does naturally ſpring up in the mind of a good man; <hi>great
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59944:138"/>peace have they that love thy Law, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall offend them.</hi> All Acts of piety and vertue are not onely delightful for the preſent, but they leave peace and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment behind them: a peace that no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward violence can interrupt or take from us. The pleaſures of a holy life have moreover this peculiar advantage of all worldly joys, that we ſhall never be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them; we cannot be cloy'd by the frequent repetition of theſe pleaſures, nor by the long enjoyment of them. I know that ſome vices pretend to bring great pleaſure along with them, and that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of a ſenſual and voluptuous life make a glorious ſhow and are attended with much pomp and noiſe, like the ſports of children and fools which are loud and clamorous; or, as <hi>Solomon</hi> elegantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them, <hi>like the crackling of thorns un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pot,</hi> which makes a little noiſe and a ſudden blaze that is preſently over. But the ſerious and the manly pleaſures, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and ſubſtantial joys, are onely to be found in the ways of Religion and Vertue. The moſt ſenſual man that ever was in the world never felt his heart touch'd with ſo delicious and laſting a pleaſure as that is which ſprings from a clear conſcience, and a mind fully ſatisfied with its own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <pb n="228" facs="tcp:59944:139"/>
            <p n="2">2. But the great encouragement of all is the aſſurance of a future reward. The firm perſwaſion whereof is enough to raiſe us above any thing in this world, and to animate us with courage and reſolution againſt the greateſt difficulties. So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> reaſons; <hi>His commandments are not grievous; for whatſoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith.</hi> The belief of a future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and glory was that which made the primitive Chriſtians ſo victorious over the world, and gave them the courage to reſiſt all the pleaſures and terrors of Senſe. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deny'd, but that a religious courſe of life is liable to be incumbred with many difficulties which are naturally grievous to fleſh and blood. But a Chriſtian is able to comfort himſelf under all theſe with the thoughts of his end, which is <hi>everlaſting life.</hi> He conſiders the goodneſs of God which he believes would not deny him the free enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the things of this world, were it not that he hath ſuch joys and pleaſures in ſtore for him as will abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence his preſent ſelf denial and ſufferings.</p>
            <p>Let us now put both theſe together, the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of Religion and the <hi>rewards</hi> of it, and they cannot but appear to be a
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59944:139"/>mighty encouragement. With what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures does a man that lives a holy and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life deſpiſe the pleaſures of ſin, and notwithſtanding all the allurements of ſenſe perſiſt reſolutely in his courſe? And how is ſuch a man confirm'd in his purpoſe and animated in his holy reſolution, when he finds that God and his own conſcience do applaud his choice; when all along in the courſe of Religion and a vertuous life, in his conflicts with ſin and reſiſtance of temptations, he hath for his preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the two great pleaſures of innocence and of victory, and for his future encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement the joyful hopes of a Crown and a Kingdom? A recompence ſo great, as is ſufficient to make a lame man walk, enough to make any one willing to offer violence to his ſtrongeſt paſſions and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. A man would be content to ſtrive with himſelf and to conflict with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, in hopes of a mighty reward. What poor man would not cheerfully carry a great burthen of gold and ſilver, that were aſſur'd to have the greateſt ſhare of it for his pains, and thereby to be made a man for ever? Whatever difficulties Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is attended withall they are all ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd and made eaſie by the propoſal of a great and eternal reward.</p>
            <pb n="230" facs="tcp:59944:140"/>
            <p>But are there no difficulties then in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Is every thing ſo plain and eaſie? Are all the ways of vertue ſo ſmooth and even as we have here repreſented them? Hath not our <hi>Saviour</hi> told us,<note place="margin">Mat 7.14.</note> that <hi>ſtrait is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 14.22.</note> Does not the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> ſay, <hi>that through much tributation we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim 3.12.</note> And, <hi>that all that will live Godly in Chriſt Ieſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution?</hi> And does not the <hi>Scripture</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where ſpeak of <hi>ſtriving</hi> and <hi>wreſtling,</hi> and <hi>running,</hi> and <hi>fighting;</hi> of <hi>labouring,</hi> and <hi>watching,</hi> and <hi>giving all diligence?</hi> And is there nothing grievous in all this?</p>
            <p>This is a very material objection, and therefore I ſhall be the more carefull to give a ſatisfactory anſwer to it. And that I may do it the more diſtinctly be pleas'd to conſider theſe <hi>ſix</hi> things. 1. That the ſuffering of perſecution for Religion is an extraordinary caſe, which did chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity. 2. That this diſcourſe concerning the eaſineſs of God's commands does all along ſuppoſe and acknowledge the difficulties of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon a Religious courſe. 3. Nor is there any reaſon it ſhould exclude our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care and diligence. 4. All the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion are very much mitigated
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59944:140"/>and allayed by hope and by love. 5. There is incomparably more difficulty and trouble in the ways of ſin and vice than in the ways of Religion and Vertue. 6. If we do but put vertue and vice, a religious and a wicked courſe of life in equal circumſtances; if we will but ſuppoſe a man as much accuſtom'd and inur'd to the one as he has been to the other, then I ſhall not doubt to pronounce that the advantages of eaſe and pleaſure will be found to be on the ſide of Religion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The ſuffering of perſecution for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is an extraordinary caſe, and did chiefly concern the firſt Ages of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And therefore the general ſayings of our Saviour and his Apoſtles concerning the perſecuted ſtate of Chriſtians are to be limited, as doubtleſs they were intended, principally to thoſe firſt times and by no means to be equally extended to all Ages of the Church. At firſt indeed whoever embrac'd the profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity did thereby expoſe themſelves to all the ſufferings which the power and malice of the world could afflict them withall: But ſince <hi>the Kingdoms of the Earth became the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt,</hi> and the Governours of the world began to be Patrons of the Church, 'tis ſo far from being univerſally
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59944:141"/>true that every Chriſtian hath ſuffer'd the violence of perſecution, that it hath been a rare caſe and happen'd onely in ſome few ages, and to ſome perſons. So that this is accidental to a ſtate of Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be reckon'd among the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary difficulties of it. And when it happens God gives extraordinary ſupports, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes mighty rewards to make it tolerable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This diſcourſe concerning the eaſineſs of God's commands does all along ſuppoſe and acknowledge the difficulties of the firſt entrance upon a religious courſe, except onely in thoſe perſons who have had the happineſs to be train'd up to Religion by the eaſie and inſenſible degrees of a pious and vertuous education. Theſe indeed are freed from a great deal of pains and difficulty which others who are reclaim'd from a bad courſe of life muſt expect to undergo. They are in a great meaſure excuſed from the pangs of the new birth, from the pains of a ſudden and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent change, from the terrours of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted mind, and from the deep and piercing ſorrows of a more ſolemn repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Whereas thoſe who have lived wickedly before muſt look to meet with a great deal more trouble, becauſe they are put upon changing the whole courſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59944:141"/>of their life at once, and muſt contend with inveterate habits, and offer no ſmall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to themſelves in plucking up thoſe vices which have been rooted in them by long cuſtome and continuance. This indeed is grievous and muſt needs be ſenſibly pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, like the <hi>plucking out of a right eye,</hi> or the <hi>cutting off a right hand:</hi> For in this caſe a man muſt ſtrive againſt the very bent and inclination of his ſtrongeſt appetites, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tyranny of cuſtome and the mighty power of a ſecond nature. But this is no juſt reflection upon religion, becauſe this does not proceed from the nature of God's laws but from an accidental indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in our ſelves, which Religion is apt to remove: And if we will but allow ſome time of trouble and uneaſineſs for the cure, when that is once wrought the commands of God will be more eaſie and delightfull to us than ever our ſins and luſts were.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Nor does this exclude our after care and diligence. For when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays that <hi>the commandments of God are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,</hi> he does by no means intend to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate that they are calculated for ſlothfull and lazy perſons, that they are ſo eaſy as to require no induſtry and endeavour on our part; he onely aims to prevent a tacit objection which lies at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59944:142"/>of many mens hearts, as if Religion were a moſt grievous and intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and there were more trouble and leſs pleaſure in it than in any other action of humane life. This he utterly denies, but does not hereby intend to exclude ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and induſtry as men uſe about other matters. And if I ſhould tell you, that the buſineſs of Religion does not require a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vigorous proſecution and great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of endeavour, I ſhall ſpeak quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> which ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly command <hi>ſeeking</hi> and <hi>ſtriving</hi> and <hi>labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> beſides many other ſuch <hi>phraſes</hi> that import diligence and earneſtneſs. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it were unfit that ſo excellent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a reward as the <hi>Goſpel</hi> promiſes ſhould ſtoop down like fruit upon a full-laden bough to be pluck'd by every idle and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton hand; that Heaven ſhould be proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to the lazy deſires and faint wiſhes, to the cheap and ordinary endeavours of ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men. God will not ſo much diſparage eternal life and happineſs, as to beſtow it upon thoſe who have conceived ſo low an opinion of it as not to think it worth the labouring for. And ſurely this is ſufficient to recommend Religion to any conſiderate man, if the advantages of it be much greater than of any worldly deſign that we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59944:142"/>to our ſelves, and the difficulties of it not greater. If the ſame ſeriouſneſs and induſtry of endeavour, which men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſe to raiſe a fortune and advance themſelves in the world, will ſerve to make a man a good man and to bring him to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, what reaſon hath any man to complain of the hard terms of Religion? And I think I may truly ſay that uſually leſs than this does it. For God conſiders our condition in this world and the preſſing neceſſities of this life, that we are fleſh as well as ſpirit and that we have great need of theſe things, and therefore he allows us to be very ſedulous and induſtrious about them. However this I am ſure of, that if men would be as ſerious to ſave their immortal ſouls as they are to ſupport theſe dying bodies; if they would but provide for eternity with the ſame ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude and real care as they do for this life; if they would but ſeek Heaven with the ſame ardour of affection, and vigour of proſecution as they ſeek earthly things; if they would but love God as much as many men do the World, and mind godlineſs as much as men uſually do gain; if they would but go to Church with as good a will as men ordinarily do to their Markets and Fairs, and be in as good earneſt at their devotions as men commonly are in dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59944:143"/>a bargain; if they would but endure ſome troubles and inconveniences in the ways of Religion with the ſame patience and conſtancy as they can do ſtorms, and foul ways and miſchances, when they are travelling about their worldly occaſions; If they would but avoid bad company as men uſe to do cheaters, and reject the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the devil and the world as they would do the kind words and inſinuations of a man whom they verily believe to have a deſign to over-reach them; I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that ſuch a one could not fail of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and would be much ſurer of it upon theſe terms, than any man that doth all the other things could be of getting an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or of attaining any thing in this world.</p>
            <p>And cannot every man do thus much? All that I have ſaid ſignifies no more but that men ſhould uſe their ſincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and this ſurely every man can do. For to uſe our ſincere endeavours is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to do as much as we can, and it is non-ſenſe for any man to deny that he can do as much as he can. And if we would do thus much we are ſure of God's grace and aſſiſtance, which is never wanting to the ſincere endeavours of men. But men expect that Religion ſhould coſt them no pains, that happineſs ſhould drop into their
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59944:143"/>laps without any deſign and endeavour on their part, and that after they have done what they pleaſe while they live God ſhould ſnatch them up to Heaven when they dye. But though <hi>the commandments of God be not grievous,</hi> yet it is ſit to let men know that they are not thus eaſie.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. All the difficulties of Religion are very much allay'd and ſweeten'd by <hi>hope</hi> and by <hi>love.</hi> By the <hi>hopes</hi> of a mighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; ſo great as is enough to raiſe us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our ſelves, and to make us break through all difficulties and diſcouragements: And by the <hi>love</hi> of God, who hath taken all imaginable ways to endear himſelf to us. He gave us our beings, and when we were fallen from that happineſs to which at firſt we were deſign'd, he was pleas'd to reſtore us to a new capacity of it by ſending his onely Son into the world to die for us. So that if we have any ſenſe of kindneſs we cannot but love him who hath done ſo much to oblige us, and if we love him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely nothing that he commands will be grievous to us; nay, ſo far from that, that the greateſt pleaſure we are capable of will be to pleaſe him. For nothing is difficult to love. It will make a man deny himſelf and croſs his own inclinations to pleaſure them whom he loves. It is a paſſion of a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59944:144"/>ſtrange power where it reigns, and will cauſe a man to ſubmit to thoſe things with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which in other circumſtances would ſeem grievous to him. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerv'd for <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel ſeven years,</hi> and after that <hi>ſeven years more; and they ſeemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.</hi> Did but the love of God rule in our hearts, and had we as real an affection for him as ſome men have for their friends, there are no ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in Religion but what love would conquer, and the ſevereſt parts of it would become eaſie when they were once under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by a willing mind.</p>
            <p n="5">V. There is incomparably more trouble in the ways of ſin and vice than in thoſe of Religion and Vertue. Every notorious ſin is naturally attended with ſome inconvenience of harm, or danger, or diſgrace; which the ſinner ſeldom conſiders till the ſin be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and then he is in a labyrinth, and in ſeeking the way out of a preſent incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience he intangles himſelf in more. He is glad to make uſe of indirect arts, and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious crafts, to avoid the conſequence of his faults; and many times is fain to cover one ſin with another, and the more he ſtrives to diſentangle himſelf the more is he <hi>ſnar'd in the work of his own hands.</hi> Into what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities did <hi>David</hi>'s ſin bring him? ſuch as
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59944:144"/>by all his power and arts he could not free himſelf from: He was glad to commit a greater crime to avoid the ſhame of a leſs, and could find no other way to conceal his adultery but by plunging himſelf into the guilt of murther. And thus it is proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in all other vices. The ways of ſin are <hi>crooked paths,</hi> full of windings and turnings; but <hi>the way of holineſs</hi> and vertue is a <hi>high way,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 35.8.</note> and lies ſo plain before us that <hi>wayfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men, though fools ſhall not err therein.</hi> There needs no skill to keep a mans ſelf true and honeſt, if we will but reſolve to deal juſtly and to <hi>ſpeak the truth to our neighbour</hi> nothing in the whole world is eaſier: For there is nothing of artifice and reach required to enable a man to ſpeak as he thinks, and to do to others as he would be dealt withal himſelf.</p>
            <p>And as the ways of ſin are full of intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and perplexities, ſo likewiſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſquiet. There is no man that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully commits any ſin but his conſcience ſmites him for it, and his guilty mind is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently gall'd with the remembrance of it, but the reflection upon honeſt and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions hath nothing of regret and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet in it. No man's conſcience ever trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him for not being honeſt, no man's reaſon ever challeng'd him for not being
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59944:145"/>drunk, no man ever broke his ſleep or was haunted with fears of divine vengeance becauſe he was conſcious to himſelf that he had <hi>liv'd ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in the world.</hi> But with the ungodly it is not ſo. There is no man that is knowingly wicked but he is guilty to himſelf, and there is no man that carries guilt about him but he hath received a ſting into his Soul which makes him reſtleſs, ſo that he can never have any perfect caſe and pleaſure in his mind.</p>
            <p>I might have deſcended to particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and have ſhewn how much more troubleſome the practice of every ſin and vice is than the exerciſe of the contrary grace and vertue; but that would be too large a Subject to be brought within the limits of a ſingle diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Let but vertue and vice, a religious and wicked courſe of life be put in equal cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, do but ſuppoſe a man to be as much accuſtom'd and ſnur'd to the one as he has been to the other, and then I doubt not but the advantages of eaſe and pleaſure, will be found to be on the ſide of Religion: and if we do not put the caſe thus we make an unequal compariſon. For there is no man but when he firſt begins a wicked courſe feels a great deal of regret in his mind, the terrours of his conſcience and the fears of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59944:145"/>damnation are very troubleſom to him. It is poſſible that by degrees a man may harden his conſcience, and by a long cuſtome of his conſcience, and by a long cuſtome of ſinning may in a great meaſure wear off that tender ſenſe of good and evil which makes ſin ſo uneaſie: But then if in the practice of a holy life a man may by the ſame degrees arrive to far greater peace and tranquillity of mind than ever any wicked man found in a ſinful courſe, if by cuſtome vertue will come to be more pleaſant than ever vice was, then the advantage is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ſide of Religion. And this is truly the caſe. It is troubleſom at firſt for a man to begin any new courſe, and to do contrary to what he hath been accuſtom'd to; but let a man but habituate himſelf to a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and vertuous life, and the trouble will go off by degrees and unſpeakable pleaſure ſucceed in the room of it. It is an excellent rule which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> gave to his Scholars, <hi>optimum vitae genus eligito, nam conſuetudo faciet j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cundiſſmum; pitch upon the beſt courſe of life,</hi> reſolve always to do that which is moſt reaſonable and vertuous, <hi>and cuſtom will ſoon render it the moſt eaſie.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of difficulty in a good life but what may be conquer'd by cuſtome as well as the difficulties of any other courſe, and when a man is once us'd to it the pleaſure of it will be greater than of any other courſe.</p>
            <pb n="242" facs="tcp:59944:146"/>
            <p>Let no man then decline or forſake Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for the pretended difficulties of it, and lay aſide all cares of God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this ſuggeſtion that they are impoſſible to be kept. For you ſee they are not only poſſible but eaſie. And thoſe who upon pretence of the trouble and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion abandon themſelves to a wicked courſe of life may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that they take more pains to make themſelves miſerable than would ſerve to bring them to happineſs. There is no man that is a ſervant of ſin, and a ſlave to any baſe luſt, but might if he pleas'd get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with leſs trouble than he goes to Hell.</p>
            <p>So that upon conſideration of the whole matter, there is no reaſon why any man ſhould be deterr'd from a holy and vertuous life for fear of the labour and pains of it. Becauſe every one that is wicked takes more pains in another way, and is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious onely to a worſe purpoſe. Now he that can travel in deep and foul ways ought not to ſay that he cannot walk in fair. He that ventures to run upon a precipice when every ſtep he takes is with danger of his life and his ſoul, ought not to pretend any thing againſt the plain and ſafe paths of Religion, which will entertain us with pleaſure all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the way, and crown us with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs at the end.</p>

            <p n="1">I. What obligation the profeſſion of Chriſtianity lays upon men to live holy lives. He that calls himſelf a Chriſtian profeſſeth to entertain the Doctrine of Chriſt, to live in the imitation of his holy example, and to have ſolemnly engaged himſelf to all this. I ſhall ſpeak briefly to theſe, and then come to that which I prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intend, to perſwade men to live accordingly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He that profeſſeth himſelf a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profeſſeth to entertain the doctrine of Chriſt, to believe the whole Goſpel, to aſſent to all the articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, to all the precepts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and theatnings of the Goſpel. Now the great deſign, the proper inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this doctrine is to take men off from ſin, and to direct and encourage them to a holy life. It teacheth us what we are to believe concerning God and Chriſt, not with any deſign to entertain our minds
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59944:148"/>with the bare ſpeculation of thoſe truths but to better our lives. For every article of our faith is a proper argument againſt ſin, and a powerfull motive to obedience. The whole hiſtory of Chriſt's appearance in the world, all the diſcourſes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his life, and the ſufferings of his death do all tend to this; the ultimate iſſue of all is the <hi>deſtroying of ſin;</hi> So St. <hi>John</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.8.</note>

            <p>Therefore the Apoſtle calls the <hi>Goſpel the power of God unto ſalvation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.16, 18.</note> becauſe therein the <hi>wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of men.</hi> So that if we call our ſelves Chriſtians we profeſs to embrace the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59944:149"/>holy doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion which is perfectly oppoſite to all impiety and wickedneſs of life. We profeſs to be governed by thoſe laws which do ſtrictly enjoyn holineſs and vertue. We profeſs to be perſwaded that all the promiſes and threatnings of the Goſpel are true, which offer ſuch great and glorious rewards to obedience and threaten tranſgreſſion and diſobedience with ſuch dreadfull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And if ſo, we are obliged both by our reaſon and our intereſt to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that profeſſeth himſelf a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profeſſeth to live in the imitation of Chriſt's example and to follow his ſteps <hi>who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> The Son of God came into the world not onely by his Doctrine to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in the way to happineſs and by his death to make expiation of ſin, but by his life to be an example to us of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vertue. Therefore in Scripture we find ſeveral <hi>Titles</hi> given him which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his exemplarineſs, as of a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>Captain,</hi> a <hi>Maſter</hi> and a <hi>Guide.</hi> Now if he be our pattern we ſhould endeavour to be like him, <hi>to have the ſame mind that was in Chriſt Jeſus; to walk in love as he alſo hath loved us and given himſelf for us.</hi>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:59944:150"/>We ſhould aſpire after the higheſt degree of holineſs, make it our conſtant and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere endeavour to pleaſe God and do his will and <hi>to fulfill all righteouſneſs</hi> as he did. Does any man profeſs himſelf a Chriſtian and yet abandons himſelf to intemperance and filthy luſts? is this like our Saviour? Are we cruel and unmercifull? is this like the High Prieſt of our profeſſion? Are we proud and paſſionate, malicious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull? is this to be like-minded with Chriſt who was meek and lowly in Spirit, who prayed for his enemies and offer'd up his blood to God on the behalf of them that ſhed it? If we call our ſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans we profeſs to have the life of Chriſt continually before us, and to be always correcting and reforming our lives by that pattern.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He that calls himſelf a Chriſtian hath ſolemnly engaged himſelf to renounce all ſin and to live a holy life. By Baptiſm we have ſolemnly taken upon us the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, and engaged our ſelves to renounce the Devil and all his works, and obediently to keep God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Anciently thoſe who were baptized put off their garments, which ſignified the putting off the body of ſin; and were immers'd and buried in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59944:150"/>to repreſent their death of ſin; and then did riſe up again out of the water, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their enterance upon a new life. And to theſe cuſtoms the Apoſtle alludes when he ſays, <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin live any longer therein;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Know ye not, that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt were baptized into his death? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are buried with him in baptiſm into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life: For if we have been planted together in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his death we ſhall be alſo in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his reſurrection, knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we might not ſerve ſin.</hi> So that by Baptiſm we profeſs to be entered into a new ſtate, and to be endued with a new nature; <hi>to have put off the old man with his deeds;</hi> to have quitted <hi>our former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which is corrupt according to the deceitfull luſts,</hi> and to be <hi>renewed in the ſpirit of our minds,</hi> and to have <hi>put on the new man which after God is created in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and true holineſs.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſm is called the <hi>putting on of Chriſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.27.</note> 
               <hi>As many of you as have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> Now
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59944:151"/>if we profeſs to have put on Chriſt we muſt quit and renounce our luſts, becauſe theſe are inconſiſtent, as appears by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which the Apoſtle makes between them; <hi>Put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make not proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts thereof.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And as we did ſolemnly covenant with God to this purpoſe in Baptiſm, ſo we do ſolemnly renew this obligation ſo often as we receive the bleſſed Sacrament of Chriſt's Body and Blood. Therefore the cup in the Sacrament is called the <hi>new Covenant in his Blood,</hi> that is, this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the ſhedding of Chriſt's blood by which rite the covenant between God and man is ratified. And as by this God doth confirm his promiſes to us, ſo we do oblige our ſelves to be faithfull and obedient to him, <hi>and if we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth,</hi> that is, after we are become Chriſtians, <hi>we account the blood of the Covenant a common thing,</hi> that is, we make nothing of the ſolemneſt <hi>rite</hi> that ever was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the world for confirmation of any covenant, the ſhedding of the blood of the ſon of God. And that this was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways underſtood to be the meaning of this holy Sacrament, to renew our Covenant
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59944:151"/>with God, and ſolemnly to confirm our reſolutions of a holy life is very plain from that account which <hi>Pliny</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin.</hi> Epiſt. L. 10. Epiſt. 97.</note> gives us of the worſhip of the Chriſtians in a Letter to <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour; in which he tells him <hi>that they aſſembled early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before day, to ſing a Hymn to Chriſt as God;</hi> and then (ſaith he) they do <hi>ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento ſe obſtringere, bind themſelves by a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament or oath not to rob or ſteal or commit adultery, not to break their word or falſiſie their truſt, and after they have eaten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they depart home.</hi> Which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an account of the Chriſtians celebrating of the holy Sacrament, which it ſeems was then look'd upon as an <hi>oath</hi> whereby Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did ſolemnly covenant and engage themſelves againſt all wickedneſs and vice.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what obligation the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity lays upon us to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of life. From all which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Goſpel requires ſomething on our part. For the Covenant between God and us is a mutual engagement, and as there are <hi>bleſſings</hi> promiſed on his part ſo there are <hi>conditions</hi> to be performed on ours. And if we live wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy lives, if we neglect our duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words God we have no title at all to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59944:152"/>the bleſſings of this Covenant. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doctrine to this hath been greedily entertained to the vaſt prejudice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, as if in this new Covenant of the Goſpel God took all upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and required nothing or as good as nothing, of us, that it would be a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the freedom of God's grace to think he expects any thing from us. That the Goſpel is all promiſes and our part is onely to believe and embrace them, that is to be confident that God will perform them if we can but think ſo, though we do nothing elſe; which is an eaſie condition to fools but the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the world to a wiſe man, who if his ſalvation depended upon it could never perſwade himſelf to believe that the holy God without any reſpect at all to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment would beſtow upon him forgiveneſs of ſins and eternal life, onely becauſe he was confident that God would do ſo. As if any man could think that it were a thing ſo highly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God that men ſhould believe of him that he loves to diſpenſe his grace and mercy upon the moſt unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable terms. A Covenant does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily imply a mutual obligation, and the Scripture plainly tells us what are
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59944:152"/>the terms and conditions of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant both on God's part and ours, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he <hi>will be our God</hi> and we <hi>ſhall be his people.</hi> But he hath no-where ſaid that though we be not <hi>his people</hi> yet he will be <hi>our God.</hi> The <hi>ſeal</hi> of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hath two <hi>inſcriptions</hi> upon it; one on God's part, that he will <hi>know them that are his;</hi> and another on our part, that we ſhall <hi>depart from iniquity.</hi> But if we will not ſubmit to this condition God will not know us, but will bid us depart from him. So our Saviour tells us, <note place="margin">Mat. 7.23.</note> 
               <hi>I will ſay unto them depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I know you not.</hi> If we deal falſly in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God and break looſe from all our engagements to him, we releaſe God from all the promiſes that he hath made to us. If we neglect to perform thoſe conditions upon which he hath ſuſpended the performance of his promiſes, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the obligation on God's part, and he remains faithfull though he deny us that happineſs which he promiſed under thoſe conditions which we have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I come now to the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prounded, and that is to perſwade thoſe who profeſs Chriſtianity to anſwer thoſe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59944:153"/>obligations to a holy life which their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion lays upon them. We all call our ſelves Chriſtians, and would be very much offended at any man that ſhould deny us this title. But let us not cheat our ſelves with an empty and inſignificant name, but if we will call our ſelves Chriſtians let us fill up this great title, and make good our profeſſion by a ſutitable life and practice. And to perſwade us hereto, I will urge theſe three conſiderations.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The indecency of the contrary.</item>
               <item>2. The great ſcandal of it to our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour and his holy Religion, and</item>
               <item>3. The infinite danger of it to our own ſouls.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider how unbecoming it is for a man to live unſuitably to his profeſſion. If we call our ſelves Chriſtians we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to entertain the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to be taught and inſtructed by the beſt maſter, to be the diſciples of the higheſt and moſt perfect inſtitution that ever was in the world, to have embraced a Religion which contains the moſt exact rules for the conduct and government of our lives, which lays down the plaineſt
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59944:153"/>precepts, ſets before us the beſt patterns and examples of a holy life, and offers us the greateſt aſſiſtances and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to this purpoſe. We profeſs to be furniſhed with the beſt arguments to excite us to holineſs and vertue, to be awed with the greateſt fears and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the beſt hopes of any men in the world.</p>
            <p>Now whoever makes ſuch a profeſſion as this obligeth himſelf to live anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to do nothing that ſhall groſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it. Nothing is more abſurd than for a man to act contrary to his profeſſion, to pretend to great matters and perform no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what he pretends to. Wiſe men will not be caught with pretences nor be impoſed upon with an empty profeſſion, but they will enquire into our lives and actions and by theſe they will make a judgment of us. They cannot ſee into our hearts nor pry into our underſtandings to diſcover what it is that we inwardly believe, they cannot diſcern thoſe ſecret and ſupernatural principles that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be acted by: But this they can do, they can examine our actions and behold our good or bad works, and try whether our lives be indeed anſwerable to our profeſſion and do really excell the lives
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59944:154"/>of other men who do not pretend to ſuch great things. There are a great many ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious perſons who will eaſily find us out, will look under our mask, and ſee through all our fine pretenſions, and will quickly diſcern the abſurdity of telling the world that we believe one thing when we do the contrary.</p>
            <p>If we profeſs to believe the Chriſtian Religion, we expoſe our ſelves to the ſcorn and contempt of every diſcerning man if we do not live up to it. With what face can any man continue in the practice of any known ſin that profeſſeth to believe the holy doctrine of the Goſpel which forbids all ſin under the higheſt and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt penalties? If we did but believe the hiſtory of the Goſpel as we do any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary credible ſtory, and did we but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Laws of Chriſtianity as we do the laws of the Land; were we but perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that fraud and oppreſſion, lying and perjury, intemperance and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, covetouſneſs and pride, malice and revenge, the neglect of God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will bring men to hell as certainly as treaſon and felony will bring a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſentence, of the Law: Had we but the ſame awe and regard for the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and promiſes of the Goſpel that we
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59944:154"/>have for the frowns and ſmiles of thoſe who are in power and authority, even this would be effectual to keep us from ſin. And if the Goſpel have not this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon us it is an argument that we do not believe it.</p>
            <p>'Tis to no purpoſe to go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men that we do heartily entertain the doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>that doctrine</hi> which hath all the characters of piety and juſtice, of holineſs and vertue upon it; which obligeth men to <hi>whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are chaſt, whatſoever things are lovely, and of good report,</hi> if we have no regard to theſe things in our lives. He that would know what a man believes, let him attend rather to what he does than to what he talks. He that leads a wicked life makes a more credible and effectual profeſſion of infidelity than he who in words onely denies the Goſpel. It is the hardeſt thing in the world to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that <hi>that</hi> man believes Chriſtianity who by ungodlineſs and worldly luſts does deny and renounce it. If we profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians, it may juſtly be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from us that we ſhould evidence this by our actions, that we ſhould live at another rate than the Heathens did
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59944:155"/>that we who worſhip a holy and juſt God ſhould not allow our ſelves the liberty to ſin as thoſe did who worſhipped ſuch Gods as were examples of ſin and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of their vices. Thou who profeſſeſt thy ſelf a Chriſtian may'ſt not walk in the luſts of the fleſh and of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as thoſe did who worſhipped a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Jupiter</hi> and a wanton <hi>Venus.</hi> Thou may'ſt not be intemperate as thoſe were who worſhipped a drunken <hi>Bacchus.</hi> Thou may'ſt not be cruel and unmerciful as thoſe were who worſhipped a fierce <hi>Saturn:</hi> Nor may'ſt thou ſteal as thoſe did who worſhipped a thieviſh <hi>Mercury.</hi> Thou muſt remember that thou art a Chriſtian, and when thou art ready to debaſe thy ſelf to any vile luſt conſider what title thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, by what name thou art called, whoſe diſciple thou art; and then ſay to thy ſelf, ſhall I allow my ſelf in any impiety or wickedneſs of life who pretend to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by that grace of God which teaches men to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts? Shall I cheriſh any ſinful paſſion who pretend to have mortified all theſe and to have <hi>put off the old man with his deeds?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not being gilded over with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal profeſſion of Chriſtianity that will
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59944:155"/>avail us, our Religion muſt be a vital principle inwardly to change and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us. What the Apoſtle ſays concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Circumciſion we may apply to them that are baptized and make an outward profeſſion of Chriſtianity; Baptiſm ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily profiteth if we obey the Goſpel, but if we walk contrary to the precepts of it our Baptiſm is no Baptiſm, and our Chriſtianity is Heatheniſm. If by our lives and actions we do contradict that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we profeſs, we do by this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing prove our ſelves to be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits and hypocrites; and that we have onely taken up our Religion for a faſhion, and received it according to cuſtom; we were born in a Countrey where it is reverenced, and therefore we are of it. And the reaſon why we are Chriſtians rather than Jews, or Turks, or Heathens, is becauſe Chriſtian Religion had the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to come firſt in our way and to beſpeak us at our entrance into the world.</p>
            <p>Are we not aſhamed to take up a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion upon ſuch ſlight grounds, and to wear about us ſuch an empty title? It ſhould make our blood to riſe in our faces to conſider what a diſtance there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Religion and our lives. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59944:156"/>
               <hi>Tully</hi> upbraids the Philoſophers very ſmartly for living unſuitably to their Doctrines. A Philoſopher (ſaith he) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable if he miſcarry in his life, <hi>quod in officio cujus magiſter eſſe vult labitur; artemque vitae profeſſus, delinquit in vita; becauſe he is faulty in that wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be a maſter, and whilſt he profeſſeth an Art of living better than other men he miſcarries in this life.</hi> With how much greater reaſon may we challenge Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for the miſcarriages of their lives, which are ſo directly contrary to their profeſſion? It may juſtly be ſuſpected that ſo perfect an inſtitution as the Goſpel is, which the Son of God came from Heaven on purpoſe to propagate in the world, ſhould make men more ſtrictly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vertuous, and ſet the profeſſors of it at a greater diſtance from all impurity and vice than ever any inſtitution in the world did. If a man profeſs any other <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Calling</hi> it is expected that he ſhould be skilled in it and excell thoſe who do not pretend to it. 'Tis the greateſt diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Phyſician that can be to ſay of him, that he is in other reſpects an excellent man onely he hath no great skill in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and the methods of cure, becauſe this is his <hi>Profeſſion:</hi> He might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59944:156"/>for other defects, but the proper skill of his <hi>Art</hi> may juſtly be expected from him. So for a Chriſtian; to ſay of him, the worſt thing in him is his <hi>life;</hi> he is very orthodox in his opinions, but he's an ill-natur'd man, one of very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions, he will be very frequently drunk, he makes no conſcience of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he is very uncharitable to all that differ from him: This man is faulty in his profeſſion, he is defective in that which ſhould be his excellency; he may have orthodox opinions in Religion, but when all is done there is no ſuch errour and hereſie, nothing ſo fundamentally oppoſite to Religion as a wicked life. A Chriſtian does not pretend to have a better wit or a more piercing underſtanding than a Turk or Heathen, but he profeſſeth to live better than they, to be more chaſt and more temperate, more juſt and more charitable, more meek and gentle, more loving and peaceable than other men: If he fail in this, where is the <hi>Art</hi> the man boaſts of? to what purpoſe is all this noiſe and ſtir about the Goſpel and the holy doctrine of Chriſt? If any man profeſs himſelf a Chriſtian and do not live better than others he is a mere pretender and <hi>Mountebank</hi> in Religion,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59944:157"/>he's a bungler in his own <hi>Art</hi> and unskill'd in his proper profeſſion. This is the firſt, the indecency of the thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider how great a ſcandal this muſt needs be to our bleſſed Saviour and his holy Religion. The Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath undergone many a hard cenſure for the miſcarriages of the profeſſors of it. The impieties and vices of thoſe who call themſelves Chriſtians have cauſed many ſharp reflexions upon Chriſtianity, and made the Son of God and the Bleſſed Saviour of the world to wear the odious names of deceiver and impoſtor. If a man did deſign to do the greateſt ſpight to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he could not give it a deeper wound, he could not take a more effectual courſe to diſparage it than by a lewd and debauched life. For this will ſtill be an objection in the minds of thoſe who are ſtrangers and enemies to our Religion. If the Goſpel were ſo excellent an inſtitution as it is reported to be, ſurely we ſhould ſee better effects of it in the lives of thoſe who profeſs it. When we would perſwade a Heathen to our Religion, and tell him how holy a God we ſerve, what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent patterns we imitate, what ſpiritual and divine precepts of holineſs and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue our Religion does contain; may not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59944:157"/>he reply, would you have me to believe you when I ſee you do not believe your ſelves? If you believed your Religion you would live according to it. For if the Goſpel were every word of it falſe, if there were neither a Heaven to be hoped for nor a Hell to be feared after this life, how could many Chriſtians live worſe than they do?</p>
            <p>As we would not proclaim to the world that the Goſpel is an unholy and vicious Inſtitution, let us take heed that we bring no ſcandal upon it by our lives, leſt the enemies of our Religion ſay as <hi>Salvian</hi> tells us they did in his time, <hi>Si Chriſtus Sancta docuiſſet Chriſtiani ſancte vixiſſent,</hi> ſurely <hi>if Chriſt had taught ſo holy a doctrine Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians would have lived holier lives. Tully</hi> tells us that one of the ſhrewdeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ever was brought againſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy was this, <hi>quoſdam perfectos Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos turpiter vivere, that ſome great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers led very filthy lives. Celſus</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry, Hierocles</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> among all their witty invectives againſt Chriſtian Religion have nothing againſt it that reflects ſo much upon it as do the wicked lives of ſo many Chriſtians. The greateſt enmity to Religion is to profeſs it and to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably to it.</p>
            <pb n="266" facs="tcp:59944:158"/>
            <p>This conſideration ought greatly to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us. I am ſure the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it with great paſſion and vehemency, <hi>For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny walk of whom I have told you often,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3.18</note> 
               <hi>and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is in their ſhame, who mind earthly things.</hi> A <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Turk</hi> is not ſo great an enemy to Chriſtianity as a lewd and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtian. Therefore let me beſeech Chriſtians, as they tender the honour of their Saviour and the credit of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they would conform their lives to the holy precepts of Chriſtianity. And if there be any who are reſolved to continue in a vitious courſe to the injury and diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Chriſtianity, I could almoſt entreat of them that they would quit their profeſſion and renounce their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, that they would lay aſide their title of Chriſtians and initiate themſelves in Heatheniſh rites and ſuperſtitions, or be circumciſed for <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Turks:</hi> For it were really better, upon ſome accounts, that ſuch men ſhould abandon their Profeſſion, than keep on a vizard which ſerves to no other purpoſe but to ſcare others from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And Laſtly, let us conſider the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59944:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>we expoſe our ſelves to by not living anſwerably to our Religion. And this, I hope, may prevail upon ſuch as are not moved by the former conſiderations. Hypocrites are inſtanc'd in Scripture, as a ſort of ſinners that ſhall have the ſharpeſt torments and the fierceſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. When our Saviour would ſet forth the great ſeverity of the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the evil ſervant he expreſſeth it thus,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.51.</note> 
               <hi>he ſhall cut him in ſudden and appoint him his portion with Hypocrites.</hi> So that the puniſhment of Hypocrites ſeems to be made in the meaſure and ſtandard of the higheſt puniſhment. Thou profeſſeſt to believe in Chriſt and to hope in him for ſalvation, but in the mean time thou liveſt a wicked and unholy life, thou doſt not believe but preſume on him, and wilt find at the great day that this thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will be thy confuſion, and he whom thou hopeſt will be thy Advocate and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will prove thy Accuſer and thy Judge. What our Saviour ſays to the Jews, <hi>There is one that accuſeth you even Moſes in whom ye truſt</hi> may very well be applied to falſe Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.45</note> there is one that <hi>accuſeth</hi> you and will condemn you, even <hi>Jeſus in whom ye truſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="268" facs="tcp:59944:159"/>
            <p>The profeſſion of Chriſtianity and mens having the name of Chriſt named upon them will be ſo far from ſecuring them from Hell, that it will ſink them the deeper into it. Many are apt to pity the poor Heathens who never heard of the name of Chriſt, and ſadly to condole their caſe, but as our Saviour ſaid upon another occaſion, <hi>Weep not for them, weep for your ſelves.</hi> There's no ſuch miſerable perſon in the world as a degenerate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, becauſe he falls into the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery from the greateſt advantages and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of being happy. Doſt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the condition of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> and doubt what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them at the day of Judgment? and canſt thou, who art an impious and prophane Chriſtian, think that thou ſhalt eſcape the damnation of Hell?</p>
            <p>Doſt thou believe that the moral Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſhall be caſt out? and canſt thou who haſt led a wicked life under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity have the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to hope that thou ſhalt ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of God? No, thoſe ſins which are committed by Chriſtians under the enjoyment of the Goſpel are of deeper dye and clothed with blacker aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59944:159"/>than the ſins of Heathens are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. A Pagan may live without God in the world, and be unjuſt towards men, at a cheaper rate and upon eaſier terms than thou who art a Chriſtian. Better had it been thou hadſt never known one ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of the Goſpel, never heard of the name of Chriſt than that having taken it upon thee thou ſhouldſt not <hi>depart from iniquity.</hi> Happy had it been for thee, that thou hadſt been born a Jew, or a Turk, or a poor Indian, rather than that being bred among Chriſtians and profeſſing thy ſelf of that number thou ſhouldſt lead a vitious and unholy life.</p>
            <p>I have inſiſted the longer upon theſe arguments, that I might, if poſſible, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken men to a ſerious conſideration of their lives, and perſwade them to a real reformation of them; that I may oblige all thoſe who call themſelves Chriſtians to live up to the eſſential and fundamental Laws of our Religion; to love God, and to love our neighbour; to do to every man as we would have him to do to us, to mortifie our luſts, and ſubdue our paſſions, and ſincerely to endeavour to grow in every grace and vertue, and to abound in all the fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59944:160"/>which are by Jeſus Chriſt to the praiſe and glory of God.</p>
            <p>This indeed would become our profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and be honourable to our Religion, and would remove one of the greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles to the progreſs of the Goſpel. For how can we expect that the doctrine of God our Saviour ſhould gain any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ground in the world, ſo long as by the unworthy lives of ſo many Chriſtians 'tis repreſented to the world at ſo great diſadvantage; If ever we would have Chriſtian Religion effectually recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it muſt be by the holy and unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lives of thoſe who make profeſſion of it. Then indeed it would look with ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable a countenance as to invite many to it, and carry ſo much majeſty and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it as to command reverence from its greateſt enemies, and make men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that God is in us of a truth and to glorifie our Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The good God grant that as we have taken upon us the profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, ſo we may be carefull ſo to live that we may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things; that the grace of God which bringeth
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59944:160"/>ſalvation may teach us to deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world; looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>FOR the underſtanding of which words we need to look back no further than the 18th. <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> where the Apoſtle with great vehemency and paſſion ſpeaks of ſome among the <hi>Philippians,</hi> who indeed profeſs'd Chriſtianity but yet would do any thing to decline ſuffering for that profeſſion; <hi>there are many that walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt;</hi> they cannot endure to ſuffer with him and for him, they are ſo ſenſual and wedded to this world that they will do any thing to avoid perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo he deſcribes them in the next <hi>verſe, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God

            </p>
            <p>For the right underſtanding of which <hi>phraſe</hi> be pleaſed to obſerve, that it is an alluſion to a City or Corporation, and to the privileges and manners of thoſe who are free of it. And Heaven is ſeveral times in Scripture repreſented to us under this notion of a <hi>City.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.10.</note> It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi> that <hi>he looked for a City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now to this <hi>City</hi> the Apoſtle alludes here in the Text, when he ſays <hi>our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in Heaven.</hi> For the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>So that to have <hi>our converſation in heaven</hi> does imply theſe two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſerious thoughts and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The effect which thoſe thoughts ought to have upon our lives.</p>
            <p>Theſe two things take up the meaning of my Text, and ſhall be the ſubject of the following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The ſerious thoughts and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heaven, that is, of the happy and glorious ſtate of good men in another life. And concerning this, there are two things principally which offer themſelves to our conſideration. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The happineſs of this ſtate. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The way and means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may come to partake of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <pb n="277" facs="tcp:59944:163"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We will conſider the happineſs of this ſtate. But what, and how great this happineſs is, I am not able to repreſent to you. Theſe things are yet in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure within the veil, and it does not now fully <hi>appear what we ſhall be.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have reveal'd ſo much in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reality and unſpeakable felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this ſtate as may ſatisfie us for the preſent, and ſerve to inflame our deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and to quicken our endeavours for the obtaining of it; as <hi>namely,</hi> that it is incomparably beyond any happineſs of this world; that it is very great; and that it is eternal; in a word, that it is far above any thing that we can now conceive or imagine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is incomparably beyond any hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this world. It is free from all thoſe ſharp and bitter ingredients which do abate and allay the felicities of this life. All the enjoyments of this world are mix'd, and uncertain, and unſatisfying; nay ſo far are they from giving us ſatisfaction, that the very ſweeteſt of them are ſatiating and cloying.</p>
            <p>None of the comforts of this life are pure and unmixt. There is ſomething of <hi>vanity</hi> mingled with all our earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and <hi>that</hi> cauſeth <hi>vexation of ſpirit.</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:59944:164"/>There is no ſenſual pleaſure but is either purchas'd by ſome pain, or attended with it, or ends in it. A great eſtate is neither to be got without care, nor kept without fear, nor loſt without trouble. Dignity and greatneſs is troubleſome almoſt to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it is commonly uneaſie to them that have it and it is uſually hated and envy'd by thoſe that have it not. Knowledge, that is one of the beſt and ſweeteſt pleaſures of humane life; and yet if we may believe the experience of one, who had as great a ſhare of it as any of the Sons of men ever had,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.17, 18.</note> he will tell us, that <hi>this alſo is vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit; for in much wiſdom there is much grief, and he that encreaſeth konwledge, encreaſeth ſorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is with all the things of this world; the beſt of them have a mixture of good and evil, of joy and ſorrow in them: but the happineſs of the next life is free from allay and mixture. In the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>there ſhall be no more curſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 22.3, 5.</note> 
               <hi>and there ſhall be no night there,</hi> nothing to imbitter our bleſſings, or obſcure our glory. Heaven is the proper region of happineſs, there onely are pure joys and an unmingled fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>
            <p>But the enjoyments of this world as
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59944:164"/>they are mix'd, ſo they are uncertain. So wavering and inconſtant are they that we can have no ſecurity of them, when we think our ſelves to have the faſteſt hold of them they ſlip out of our hands we know not how. For this reaſon <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> very elegantly calls them things <hi>that are not, Why wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make to themſelves wings and flie like an Eagle towards heaven.</hi> So fugitive are they, that after all our endeavours to ſecure them they may break looſe from us and in an inſtant vaniſh out of our ſight, <hi>riches make to themſelves wings, and flie like an Eagle,</hi> intimating to us that riches are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten acceſſary to their own ruin. Many times the greatneſs of a man's eſtate, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, hath been the cauſe of the loſs of it, and of taking away the life of the owner thereof. The <hi>fairneſs</hi> of ſome mens fortune hath been a temptation to thoſe who have been more powerfull to <hi>raviſh</hi> it from them, thus <hi>riches make to themſelves wings.</hi> So that he that enjoys the greateſt happineſs of this world does ſtill want one happineſs more, to ſecure to him for the future what he poſſeſſes for the perſent. But the happineſs of Heaven is a ſteady and conſtant light, fixt and unchangeable
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59944:165"/>as the fountain from whence it ſprings, <hi>the father of lights, with whom is no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor ſhadow of turning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the enjoyments of this life were certain, yet they are unſatisfying. This is the <hi>vanity of vanities,</hi> that every thing in this world can trouble us but nothing can give us ſatisfaction. I know not how it is, but either we, or the things of this world, or both, are ſo phantaſtical, that we can neither be well with theſe things, nor well without them. If we be hungry, we are in pain; and if we eat to the full, we are uneaſie. If we be poor we think our ſelves miſerable, and when we come to be rich we commonly really are ſo. If we are in a low condition we fret and murmur, and if we chance to get up and to be rais'd to greatneſs we are many times farther from contentment than we were before. So that we purſue the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this world juſt as little children chaſe birds, when we think we are come very near it and have it almoſt in our hands it flies farther from us than it was at firſt.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſo far are the enjoyments of this world from affording us ſatisfaction, that the ſweeteſt of them are moſt apt to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate and cloy us. All the pleaſures of this
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59944:165"/>world are ſo contriv'd as to yeild us very little happineſs. If they go off quickly they ſignifie nothing, and if they ſtay long we are ſick of them. After a full draught of any ſenſual pleaſure we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently loath it, and hate it as much after the enjoyment as we courted it and long'd for it in the expectation. But the delights of the other world, as they will give us full ſatisfaction ſo we ſhall never be weary of them. Every repetition of them will be accompanied with a new pleaſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. In the felicities of Heaven theſe two things ſhall be reconcil'd, which never met together in any ſenſual delight, long and full enjoyment and yet a freſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual pleaſure. As in God's <hi>preſence there is fulneſs of joy,</hi> ſo <hi>at his right hand there ſhall be pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The happineſs of the other life is not onely incomparably beyond any happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world (that, it may be, is no great commendation of it) but it is very great in it ſelf. The happineſs of Heaven is uſually in Scripture deſcirb'd to us by ſuch pleaſures as are manly and excellent, chaſt and intellectual, infinitely more pure and refin'd than thoſe of ſenſe; and if the Scripture at any time deſcend to the metaphors of a <hi>feaſt,</hi> and a <hi>banquet,</hi> and a
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59944:166"/>
               <hi>marriage,</hi> it is plainly by way of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation to our weakneſs and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our capacities.</p>
            <p>But the chief ingredients of this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo far as the Scripture hath thought fit to reveal it to us, are the perfection of our knowledge, and the height of our love, and the perpetual ſociety and friendſhip of all the bleſſed inhabitants of thoſe glorious manſions; and the joyfull concurrence of all theſe in chearfull expreſſions of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in the inceſſant praiſes and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fountain and author of all this happineſs. And what can be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull than to have our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings entertain'd with a clear ſight of the beſt and moſt perfect Being, with the knowledge of all his works and of the wiſe deſigns of his providence here in the world? than to live in the reviving pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and to be continually atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon him whoſe favour is life, and whoſe glory is much more above that of any of the Princes of this world than the greateſt of them is above the pooreſt worm? The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> thought <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Servants happy in having the opportunity by ſtanding continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to hear his wiſdom; but in the other world it ſhall be a happineſs to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:59944:166"/>himſelf, and to the wiſeſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſons that ever were in this world, to ſtand before this great King to admire his wiſdom and to behold his glory. Not that I imagine the happineſs of Heaven to conſiſt in a perpetual gazing upon God, and in an idle contemplation of the glories of that place. For as by that bleſſed ſight we ſhall be infinitely tranſported, ſo the Scripture tells us we ſhall be alſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into the image of the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; we <hi>ſhall ſee God and we ſhall be like him,</hi> and what greater happineſs can there be than to be like the happieſt and moſt perfect Being in the world? Beſides, who can tell what employment God may have for us in the next life? We need not doubt but that he who is happineſs it ſelf, and hath promis'd to make us happy, can eaſily find out ſuch employments and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights for us in the other world as will be proper and ſuitable to that ſtate.</p>
            <p>But then beſides the improvement of our knowledge, there ſhall be the moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full exerciſe of love. When we come to heaven we ſhall enter into the ſociety of the bleſſed Angels and of <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> that is, freed from all thoſe paſſions and infirmities which do now render the converſation, even of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59944:167"/>the beſt men, ſometimes troubleſome to one another. We ſhall then meet with all thoſe excellent Perſons, thoſe brave Minds, thoſe innocent and charitable Souls whom we have ſeen, and heard, and read of in this world. There we ſhall meet with many of our dear relations and intimate friends, and perhaps with many of our enemies, to whom we ſhall then be perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd notwithſtanding all the warm conteſts and peeviſh differences which we had with them in this world, even about matters of Religion. For Heaven is a ſtate of perfect love and friendſhip, there will be nothing but kindneſs and good nature there, and all the prudent Arts of endearment and wiſe ways of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring converſation mutually pleaſant to one another. And what greater happineſs can be imagin'd than to converſe freely with ſo many excellent perſons, without any thing of folly or diſguiſe, of jealouſie or deſign upon one another? For then there will be none of thoſe vices and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of covetouſneſs and ambition, of envy and hatred, of wrath and peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which do now ſo much ſpoil the pleaſure and diſturb the quiet of mankind. All quarrels and contentions, ſchiſms and diviſions will then be effectually hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59944:167"/>not by force but by love, not by compulſion but by that <hi>charity which never fails;</hi> and all thoſe controverſies in Religion which are now ſo hotly agitated will then be finally determin'd, not as we endeavour to end them now by Canons and Decrees, but by a perfect knowledge and convincing light.</p>
            <p>And when this bleſſed ſociety is met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and thus united by love, they ſhall all joyn in gratitude to their great Patrons and Benefactors, <hi>to him that ſits upon the Throne and to the lamb that was ſlain, to God even our Father, and to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath lov'd us and waſh'd us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi> And they ſhall ſing everlaſting ſongs of praiſe to God for all his works of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for the effects of that infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and admirable wiſdom, and almighty power, which are clearly ſeen in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and government of the world and of all the Creatures in it; particularly for his favours to mankind, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their beings, for the comfort of their lives, and for all his mercifull providences towards them in this world: But above all for the redemption of their ſouls by the death of his Son for the free forgiveneſs of their ſins, for the gracious aſſiſtance of his
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59944:168"/>holy Spirit, and for conducting them ſafely through all the ſnares and dangers, the troubles and temptations of this world to the ſecure poſſeſſion of that glory and happineſs which then they ſhall be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of, and are bound to praiſe God for to all eternity. This, this ſhall be the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the bleſſed ſpirits above, and theſe are the chief ingredients of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which the Scripture mentions. And if there were no other as there may be ten thouſand more for any thing I can tell, yet generous and vertuous minds will eaſily underſtand how great a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure there is in the improvement of our knowledge, and the exerciſe of love, and in a gratefull and perpetual acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greateſt benefits that creatures are capable of receiving.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This happineſs ſhall be eternal. And though this be but a circumſtance and do not enter into the nature of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet it is ſo material a one that all the felicities which heaven affords would be imperfect without it. It would ſtrangely damp and allay all our joys to think that they ſhould ſometime have an end. And the greater our happineſs were, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trouble it would be to us to conſider that it muſt have a period. It would make a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59944:168"/>man ſorrowfull indeed to think of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch vaſt poſſeſſions. Indeed if the happineſs of heaven were ſuch as the joys of this world are, it were fit they ſhould be as ſhort; for after a little enjoyment it would cloy us, and we ſhould ſoon grow weary of it: But being ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, it would ſcarce be a happineſs if it were not eternal. It would imbitter the pleaſures of heaven, as great as they are, to ſee to an end of them, though it were at never ſo great a diſtance; to conſider that all this vaſt treaſure of happineſs would one day be exhauſted, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many years were paſt we ſhould be as poor and miſerable again as we were once in this world. God hath ſo order'd things, that the vain and empty delights of this world ſhould be temporary and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, but that the great and ſubſtantial pleaſures of the other world ſhould be as laſting as they are excellent. For Heaven as it is an <hi>exceeding,</hi> ſo it is <hi>an eternal weight of glory.</hi> And this is that which crowns the joys of heaven and baniſhes all fear and trouble from the minds of the bleſſed. And thus to be ſecur'd in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of our happineſs is an unſpeakable addition to it. For that which is eternal as it ſhall never determine, ſo it can never
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59944:169"/>be diminiſh'd; for to be diminiſh'd and to decay is to draw nearer to an end, but that which ſhall never have an end can never come nearer to it.</p>
            <p>O vaſt <hi>eternity!</hi> how doſt thou ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up our thoughts and entertain us at once with delight and amazement? This is the very top and higheſt pitch of our happineſs, upon which we may ſtand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and look down with ſcorn upon all things here below; and how ſmall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable do they appear to us, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with the vaſt and endleſs enjoyments of our future ſtate? But oh vain and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſouls! that are ſo little concern'd for eternity; that for the trifles of time, and <hi>the pleaſures of ſin which are but for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> can find in our hearts to forfeit an everlaſting felicity. Bleſſed God! why haſt thou prepar'd ſuch a happineſs for thoſe who neither conſider it, nor ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it? <hi>Why is</hi> ſuch <hi>a price put into the hands of fools, who have no heart to make uſe of it;</hi> who fondly chuſe to gratifie their luſts rather than to ſave their ſouls, and ſottiſhly prefer the temporary enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſin before a bleſſed immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, This happineſs is far above any thing that we can now conceive
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59944:169"/>or imagine. It is ſo great that it cannot now <hi>enter into the heart of man.</hi> We cannot from the experience of any of thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights which we have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withall in this world frame an equal <hi>Idea</hi> and conception of it. So that when we come to Heaven we ſhall be ready to ſay of it as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did of <hi>Solomon's</hi> wiſedom and proſperity, that <hi>half of it hath not been told us;</hi> that the felicities and glories of that ſtate do far exceed all the fame which we heard of them in this world. For who can ſay how great a good God is? and how happy he who is the fountain of happineſs can make thoſe ſouls that love him, and thoſe whom he loves?</p>
            <p>In this imperfect ſtate we are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a full repreſentation of thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. <hi>We cannot</hi> now <hi>ſee God and live.</hi> A full deſcription of Heaven and of the pleaſures of that ſtate would let in joys upon us too big for our narrow capacities, and too ſtrong for weak mortality to bear. <hi>We are now but Children, and we ſpeak as Children, and underſtand</hi> and think <hi>as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> concerning theſe things; but in the other ſtate we ſhall grow up <hi>to be men,</hi> and then we ſhall <hi>put away</hi> theſe <hi>childiſh</hi> thoughts; <hi>now we know but in part, but
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59944:170"/>when that which is perfect is come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9, 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>that which is imperfect ſhall be done away; now we ſee through a glaſs darkly</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in a riddle) but then we ſhall ſee face to face; now we know in part, but then we ſhall know even as alſo we are known,</hi> as the Apoſtle diſcourſeth excellently concerning this very matter.</p>
            <p>No ſooner ſhall we enter upon the joys of the other world, but our minds ſhall be rais'd to a ſtrength and activity as much above that of the moſt knowing perſons in this world as the thoughts of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Philoſopher and wiſeſt man upon earth are above the thoughts of a child or a fool. No man's mind is now ſo well fram'd to underſtand any thing in this world, as our underſtandings ſhall then be fitted for the knowledge of God and of the things that belong to that ſtate. In the mean time let us bleſs God that he hath reveal'd ſo much of this happineſs to us as is neceſſary to excite and encourage us to ſeek after it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing to be conſider'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our future happineſs, is the way and means whereby we may come to be made partakers of it. And that in ſhort is by the conſtant and ſincere endeavours of a holy life, in and through the mercies
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59944:170"/>of God in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt indeed is the author of our ſalvation, but obedience is the condition of it; ſo the Apoſtle tells us,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.1.</note> that Chriſt <hi>is the author of eternal ſalvation to them that obey him.</hi> It is <hi>the grace of God</hi> in the Goſpel <hi>which brings</hi> or offers this <hi>ſalvation</hi> to us, but t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en it is by the <hi>denying of ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2.11.12.</note> and by <hi>living ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world</hi> that we are <hi>to wait for the bleſſed hope.</hi> Our Saviour promiſes this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the pure in heart, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God;</hi> and elſewhere the Scripture doth exclude all others from any ſhare or portion in this bleſſedneſs, ſo the Apoſtle aſſures us <hi>that without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 18.14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And holineſs is not onely a condition but a neceſſary qualiſication for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the next life. This is the force of St. <hi>John</hi>'s reaſoning, <hi>we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him.</hi> To <hi>ſee God</hi> is to be happy, but unleſs we be like him we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee him. The ſight and preſence of God himſelf would be no happineſs to that man who is not like to God in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and diſpoſition of his mind. And from hence the Apoſtle inſers in the next <hi>verſe, every man that hath this hope in him
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59944:171"/>purifieth himſelf even as he is pure.</hi> So that if we live wicked live, if we allow our ſelves in the practice of any known ſin, we interrupt our hopes of Heaven and render our ſelves unfit for eternal life. By this means we defeat all the deſigns of God's grace and mercy towards us, and ſalvation it ſelf cannot ſave us if we make our ſelves incapable of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which God offers. Heaven is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture call'd <hi>an inheritance among them that are ſanctified,</hi> and <hi>the inheritance of the Saints in light;</hi> ſo that it is not enough that this <hi>inheritance</hi> is promis'd to us, but we muſt be qualifi'd and prepar'd for it, and <hi>be made meet to be made partakers of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this life is the time of our prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for our future ſtate. Our ſouls will continue for ever what we make them in this world. Such a temper and diſpoſition of mind as a man carries with him out of this life he ſhall retain in the next. 'Tis true indeed, heaven perfects thoſe holy and vertuous diſpoſitions which are begun here; but the other world alters no man as to his main ſlate, <hi>he that is filthy will be filthy ſtill,</hi> and <hi>he that is unrighteous will be unrighteous</hi> ſtill. If we do not in a good degree mortifie our Iuſts and paſſions here
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59944:171"/>death will not kill them for us, but we ſhall carry them with us into the other world. And if God ſhould admit us ſo qualifi'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of happineſs, yet we ſhall bring that along with us which would infallibly hinder us from being happy. Our ſenſual inclinations and deſires would meet with nothing there that would be ſuitable to them, and we ſhould be perpetually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with thoſe appetites which we brought with us out of this world, becauſe we ſhould find nothing there to gratifie them withall. For as the Apoſtle ſays in another ſenſe, <hi>The kingdom of God is not meats and drinks, but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of heaven conſiſts in ſuch things as a wicked man hath no guſt and reliſh for. So that if a covetous, or ambitious, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous man were in Heaven, he would be juſt like the rich man in Hell, tormented with a continual thirſt, and burnt up in the flames of his own ardent deſires; and would not be able, amidſt all the plenty and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of that place, to find ſo much as one drop of ſuitable pleaſure and delight to quench and allay that heat. So likewiſe our fierce and unruly paſſions; if we ſhould carry them with us into the other world, how inconſiſtent would they be
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59944:172"/>with happineſs? They would not onely make us miſerable our ſelves, but be a trouble to all thoſe with whom we ſhould converſe. If a man of an envious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, of a peeviſh and paſſionate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, were admitted into the manſions of the bleſſed, he would not onely be unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py himſelf, but would diſturb the quiet of others, and raiſe ſtorms even in thoſe calm regions. Vain man! that dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of being happy without any diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or preparation for it. To be happy, is to enjoy what we deſire and to live with thoſe whom we love. But there is nothing in heaven ſuitable to the deſires and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of a wicked man. All the joys of that place, and the delights of that ſtate are purely ſpiritual, and are onely to be reliſh'd by thoſe who have <hi>purified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as God is pure.</hi> But if thou be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ſenſual, what are theſe things to thee? What happineſs would it be to thee to ſee God, and to have him always in thy view who was never in all thy thoughts; to be tied to live for ever in his company who is of a quite contrary temper and diſpoſition to thy ſelf, whoſe preſence thou dreadeſt, and whom whilſt thou waſt in this world thou couldſt never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to think upon? So that the pleaſures
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59944:172"/>of Heaven it ſelf could ſignifie no good or happineſs to that man who is not ſo diſpos'd as to take pleaſure in them. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is too pure an air for corrupt ſouls to live and breath in, and the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and converſation of that place, as it would be unſuitable, ſo would it alſo be unacceptable to a ſenſual and vicious perſon.</p>
            <p>From all this it appears how neceſſary it is for us to prepare our ſelves for this bleſſed ſtate, by the conſtant and ſincere endeavours of a holy life, and by mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every luſt and inordinate paſſion in our ſouls. For till this be done we are not meet to be made partakers of the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the other world. And thus I have done with the <hi>firſt</hi> thing imply'd in this phraſe <hi>of having our converſation in heaven, viz.</hi> the ſerious thoughts and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of heaven; or the happineſs of that ſtate, and of the way and means whereby that happineſs is to be attained.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>having our converſation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> does imply likewiſe the effect which thoſe conſiderations ought to have upon our hearts and lives: As</p>
            <p n="1">1. To convince us of the vanity of this world. God hath on purpoſe made this
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59944:173"/>world troubleſome and uneaſie to us, that there might be no ſufficient temptation to reaſonable and conſiderate men to take them off from the care and thought of their future happineſs; that God and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven might have no rival here below; that there might be nothing in this world that might pretend to our affection or court us with any advantage in compariſon of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life and glory.</p>
            <p>When we come to die and eternity ſhall preſent it ſelf to our ſerious and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoughts, then things will put on another face, and thoſe things which we valued ſo much in this life will then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be nothing worth; but thoſe things which we neglected, to be of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite concernment to us, and worthy to have been the care and endeavour of our whole lives. And if we would conſider theſe things in time, while the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life and health are before us, we might be convinc'd at a cheaper rate, and come to be ſatisfi'd of the vanity of this world before we deſpair'd of the happineſs of the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make us very active and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be as good, and to do as much good as we can in this life, that ſo we may be qualifi'd and diſpos'd for the happineſs of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59944:173"/>the next. Men are uſually very induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the things of this life, to be rich and great in the world; did we but value heaven half as much as it deſerves we ſhould take infinitely more pains for that. So often as we conſider the glories that are above, how does it accuſe our ſloth and condemn our folly that we are leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for our ſouls than moſt men are for their bodies, that we will not labour half ſo much for an eternal inheritance as men ordinarily do for theſe corruptible things?</p>
            <p>Let us remember that we are haſting apace to another world, and that our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs now lies at the ſtake. And how ſhould it quicken our endeavours to have ſuch a reward ſet before us, to have Crowns and Scepters in our eyes? would we but often repreſent to our minds the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things of another world, what fervours ſhould we feel in our hearts? we ſhould be all life, and ſpirit, and wing; and ſhould do God's will, almoſt with the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and delight, as the <hi>Angels</hi> do <hi>who continually behold the face of their Father.</hi> The conſideration of heaven and the firm perſwaſion of our future happineſs ſhould actuate all the powers of our ſouls, and be continually inſpiring us with new vigour
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59944:174"/>in the ways of holineſs and vertue. How ſhould this thought ſwell our reſolutions and confirm our purpoſes of obedience, that if we have our <hi>fruit unto holineſs</hi> our <hi>end will be everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. To mitigate and lighten the evils and afflictions of this life. It is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how rough the way be provided we be ſure that it leads to happineſs. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably greater good of the next life will to a wiſe and conſiderate man weigh down all the evils of this. And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us that there is no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. <hi>The ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.18.</note> The evils of this life afflict men more or leſs according as the ſoul is fortified with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations proper to ſupport us under them. When we conſider that we have but a little while to be here, that we are upon our journey travelling towards our heavenly Countrey where we ſhall meet with all the delights we can deſire, it ought not to trouble us much to endure ſtorms and foul ways, and to want many of thoſe accommodations we might expect at home. This is the common fate of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and we muſt take things as we find them and not look to have every thing juſt
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59944:174"/>to our mind. Theſe difficulties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences will ſhortly be over, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few days will be quite forgotten, and be to us as if they had never been. And when we are ſafely landed in our own Country, with what pleaſure ſhall we look back upon thoſe rough and boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Seas which we have eſcap'd? The more troubles we have paſt through the kinder uſage we ſhall find when we come to our Father's houſe. So the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>our light affliction which is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> When we come to heaven our happineſs ſhall then be as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as our miſeries were here upon earth, and far greater and more laſting. And what great matter is it though we ſuffer a while in this world, provided we eſcape the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs unſufferable torments of the next; though we have not our good things in this life, if infinitely greater be reſerv'd for us and we ſhall receive them with intereſt in the other?</p>
            <p>Several of the evils and calamities of this life would be unſufferable indeed, if there were nothing better to be hoped for hereafter. If this were true, Chriſtians would not onely be of all <hi>men</hi> but of all <hi>creatures the moſt miſerable.</hi> But out Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59944:175"/>hath abundantly aſſur'd us to the contrary. And the aſſurance of this was that which made the primitive Chriſtians to embrace ſufferings with ſo much cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, <hi>to glory in tribulation,</hi> and <hi>to take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, knowing that in heaven they had a better and more enduring ſubſtance.</hi> The ſeven brethren in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> upon this perſwaſion would <hi>not accept deliverance that they might obtain a better reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> That ſtorm of ſtones which was pour'd upon St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was no more to him than a common ſhower when <hi>he ſaw the heavens open'd,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> (in whoſe cauſe he ſuffer'd) <hi>ſtanding on the right hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. To make us ſincere in all our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, words and actions, did men firmly believe the rewards of another world their Religion would not be onely in ſhew and pretence, but in life and reality, no man would put on a <hi>form of godlineſs</hi> that were deſtitute of <hi>the power of it;</hi> we ſhould do nothing for the opinion of others, but all with regard to God and our own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and be as curious of our thoughts, and moſt retir'd actions, as if we were in an open theatre and in the preſence of the greateſt aſſembly. For in the next life
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59944:175"/>men ſhall not be rewarded for what they ſeem'd to be, but for what they really were in this world. Therefore whatever we think, or ſpeak, or do, we ſhould always remember that the day of revelation is coming, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſclos'd, when all diſguiſes ſhall be laid aſide, and every ones mask ſhall be taken off, and all our actions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns ſhall be brought upon the publick ſtage and expos'd to the view of men and Angels. <hi>There is nothing</hi> now <hi>hidden which ſhall not</hi> then <hi>be reveal'd, nor ſecret which ſhall not be made known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. To arm us againſt the fears of death. Death is terrible to nature, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of it is infinitely encreas'd by the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full apprehenſions of what may follow it. But the comfortable hopes of a bleſſed immortality do ſtrangely relieve the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits of dying men, and are able to reconcile us to death, and in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to take away the terrour of it. I know that the thoughts of death are diſmal even to good men, and we have never more need of comfort and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than when we are conflicting with this laſt Enemy, and there is no ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable conſideration to a dying man as the hopes of a happy eternity. He that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59944:176"/>looks upon death onely as a paſſage to glory, may welcome the meſſengers of it as bringing him the beſt and moſt joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full news that ever came to him in his whole life. and no man can ſtay behind in this world with half the comfort that this man leaves it.</p>
            <p>And now I have done with the <hi>two</hi> things implyed in this phraſe, of <hi>having our converſation in heaven, viz.</hi> the ſerious thoughts and conſiderations of heaven, and the effect of theſe thoughts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations upon our hearts and lives.</p>
            <p>I crave your patience but a little longer, till I make ſome reflection upon what hath been deliver'd concerning the happineſs of good men after this life. I have told you that it is incomparably beyond any happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world, that it is great in it ſelf, and eternal in its duration, and far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any thing that we can now conceive or imagine. And now after all this, I am very ſenſible how much all that I have ſaid comes ſhort of the greatneſs and dignity of the thing. So that I could almoſt begin again and make a new attempt upon this ſubject. And indeed who would not be loth to be taken off from ſo delightfull an argument? Methinks 'tis good for us to be here, and to let our minds dwell upon
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59944:176"/>theſe conſiderations. We are unworthy of heaven and unfit to partake of ſo great a glory, if we cannot take pleaſure in the contemplation of thoſe things now, the poſſeſſion whereof ſhall be our happineſs for ever.</p>
            <p>With what joy then ſhould we think of thoſe <hi>great and glorious things which God hath prepar'd for them that love him, of that inheritance incorruptible, undefil'd, which fadeth not away, reſerv'd for us in the heavens?</hi> How ſhould we welcome the thoughts of that happy hour when we ſhall make our eſcape out of theſe priſons, when we ſhall paſs out <hi>of this howling wilderneſs</hi> into <hi>the promis'd Land,</hi> when we ſhall be remov'd from all the troubles and temptations of a wicked and ill-natured world; when we ſhall be paſt all ſtorms, and ſecur'd from all further danger of ſhipwreck, and ſhall be ſafely landed in the regions of bliſs and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality?</p>
            <p>O bleſſed time! <hi>When all tears ſhall be wip'd from our eyes,</hi> and <hi>death and ſorrow ſhall be no more;</hi> When <hi>mortality</hi> ſhall <hi>be ſwallow'd up of life,</hi> and we ſhall enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poſſeſſion of all that happineſs and glory which God hath promis'd, and our faith hath believ'd, and our hopes have
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59944:177"/>rais'd us to the expectation of; when we ſhall be eas'd of all our pains, and reſolv'd of all our doubts, and be purg'd from all our ſins and be free'd from all our fears, and be happy beyond all our hopes, and have all the happineſs ſecur'd to us beyond the power of time and change: When we ſhall know God and other things without ſtudy, and love him and one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure, and ſerve and praiſe him without wearineſs, and obey his will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt reluctancy; and ſhall ſtill be more and more delighted in the knowing, and loving, and praiſing, and obeying of God to all eternity.</p>
            <p>How ſhould theſe thoughts affect our hearts, and what a mighty influence ought they to have upon our lives? The great diſadvantage of the arguments fetch'd from another world is this, that thoſe things are at a great diſtance from us, and not ſenſible to us; and therefore are not apt to affect us ſo ſtrongly, and to work ſo powerfully upon us. Now to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for this diſadvantage we ſhould often revive theſe conſiderations upon our mind, and inculcate upon our ſelves the reality and certainty of theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the infinite weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of them. We ſhould reaſon thus
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59944:177"/>with our ſelves; If good men ſhall be ſo unſpeakably happy, and conſequently wicked men ſo extreamly miſerable in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world: If theſe things be true and will one day be found to be ſo, why ſhould they not be to me as if they were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy preſent? why ſhould not I be as much afraid to commit any ſin as if hell were naked before me, and I ſaw the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſeries of the damned? and why ſhould I not be as carefull to ſerve God and keep his commandments, as if heaven were open to my view, and I ſaw <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſtanding at the right hand of God with crowns of glory in his hand ready to be ſet upon the heads of all thoſe who continue faithfull to him?</p>
            <p>The lively apprehenſions of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death and eternity are apt to make mens thoughts more quick and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and according as we think our ſelves prepar'd for our future ſtate to tranſport us with joy, or to amaze us with horrour. For the ſoul that is fully ſatisfi'd of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bliſs is already entred into heaven, has begun to take poſſeſſion of glory, and has (as it were) his bleſſed Saviour in his arms, and may ſay with old <hi>Simeon, Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation.</hi> But
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59944:178"/>the thoughts of death muſt needs be very terrible to that man who is doubtfull or deſpairing of his future condition. It would daunt the ſtouteſt man that ever breathed, to look upon death when he can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but hell beyond it. When the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition at <hi>Endor</hi> told <hi>Saul, to morrow thou and thy Sons ſhall be with me,</hi> theſe words ſtruck him to the heart, ſo that <hi>he fell down to the ground, and there was no more ſtrength left in him.</hi> It is as certain that we ſhall die as if an expreſs meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould come to every one of us from the other world and tell us ſo. Why ſhould we not then always live as thoſe that muſt die, and as thoſe that hope to be happy after death? To have theſe apprehenſions vigorous and lively upon our minds this is <hi>to have our converſation in heaven, from whence alſo we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile body that it may be faſhioned like unto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body, according to the working of that mighty power whereby he is able even to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things to himſelf.</hi>
